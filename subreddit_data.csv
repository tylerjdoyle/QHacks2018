8,"b""Monero's Value""",9,"b'We\'re all about fungibility in this reddit and if you need a short, clear understanding of how important this is, you could do worse than watch this short video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3GkjuMQw0M\n\nThe questions you ask pertain to all cryptos, not just Monero. The fact is that 99.9% of the crypto market is just pure speculation. There is very little real world use - and that goes for Bitcoin too. What else can crypto do that can\'t be done at least as good, if not better, by Visa or PayPal? Not much,  but private transactions is one of them. \n\nTo go to your point, you\'re right - the public doesn\'t much care about privacy. At least not much in the USA where I\'m located. But maybe other countries care much more. Maybe all of us will care much more in the future. These are all unknowables. \n\nAs for illegality, don\'t forget that a) the vast majority of illegal transactions use cash, b) the vast majority of transactions in the DNM\'s use Bitcoin. Neither use has hurt either the reputation of cash or Bitcoin. Let\'s not point the finger at Monero unjustly. If Monero does become the dominant currency of the DNM\'s then great - at least it will be the one crypto with a use case.\n\nLastly, I leave you with this - a comment made by /u/xmr2020 a week ago. I think it superbly describes the situation we\'re up against and who the survivor(s) will be. \n\n\n/u/xmr2020: \n\n***In the ""nuclear war"" between governments and blockchains, only the cockroach protocols will survive.*** -Ari Paul\n\n**For bitcoin to make it, it needs to be banned by a few governments and critiqued by policy makers. Otherwise it will fade.** -Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\nRight now, the price of most cryptocurrencies is primarily speculation on their future potential. This is reflected in the extreme price volatility as investor confidence surges and recedes.\n\nThe only way POW blockchains can justify their very expensive existence is censorship resistant value transfer and sound digital money in highly hostile environments. In all other scenarios, Paypal\'s blockchain database works faster, cheaper, and is infinitely scalable. This is why both Taleb and Ari correctly identified that a cryptocurrency only offers lasting value if it can survive in extremely hostile environments.\n\n**In the short term the market is a popularity contest; in the long term it is a weighing machine.** - Warren Buffett\n\nRight now, blockchains are in the popularity contest phase, where any scam can attract speculation. On a long enough timeline, only censorship resistant currencies that function as sound money will survive. It\'s possible that no POW blockchain is up to this task. With Ross Ulbricht in a cage for the rest of his life, and Alexandre Cazes dead in a Thai prison, how do you think Evan Duffield, Zooko Wilcox, and Vitalik Buterin will hold up when the pressure is applied?\n\nDo you think a centralized bitcoin fork with mining, development, promotion and exchange controlled by a cartel in china is going to be the cockroach protocol that wins this war?\n\nEventually, fundamentals will come home to roost, and the weighting machine will determine the winner of the blockchain war... if there are any survivors.\n\nMonero - The Cockroach Protocol.'"
8,"b""Monero's Value""",7,"b""The thing about a privacy coin is that it is not really about privacy, but about fungibility. a word not many people know, best 'translated' as interchange-ability.  \n\nThe problem is, non-private coins like bitcoin can be 'tainted' and loose their value because the previous owner of it could have used it to buy drugs or something unlawful. there has been a legal case in the 1700's already about how fungilibity is by law baked into our current fiat system:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qomqt/what_a_landmark_legal_case_from_mid1700s_scotland/\n\nHaving that in mind, potentially Monero is the only coin that can survive long term, all the other coins will be tainted, just like 90% of dollar bills seem to have traces of cocaine and are thus unlawful.\n\nPrivacy ensures that XMR cannot be tainted.\n\nHaving said that, i never have used my XMR to do anything unlawful, and i am in fact a bit insulted by the suggestion :) We are not all crooks here!"""

12,b'Best Storing Practices needed',9,"b""I'll address each point seperately\n\n1. An SSD is generally preferred over an HDD. More specifically, an SSD will be significantly faster and it'll also improve general computer experience. Note, however, that SSDs are typically more expensive than HDDs. \n\n2. Linux (and derivatives) is (are) generally considered as best OS security wise. In addition, Windows is quite prone to malware. Furthermore, most would argue that Windows is less efficient. \n\n3. There are basically three general categories with respect two wallets, namely web wallets, hot wallets, and cold wallets. An example of a webwallet is MyMonero. Webwallets, however, are quite prone to malware. That is, there are a lot of attack vectors and, for instance, a simple malicious browser extension would be able to steal your funds. Therefore, it's generally advised to not keep more in a webwallet than one would keep in his purse. Hotwallets are basically desktop wallets (e.g. CLI / GUI) that are connected to the internet. Given that they are connected to the internet, malware would still be able to steal your funds. However, desktop wallets are generally considered more secure as web wallets, because there are simply less attack vectors. Lastly, a cold wallet is a wallet that is created on a system that is never connected to the internet. For example, cold wallets can be created on airgapped machines or LiveUSBs with networking disabled. Any of these guides would be sufficient for creating a cold wallet:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/48cgmd/an_extensive_guide_for_securely_generating_an/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6b2od3/a_stepbystep_guide_for_cold_storage_and_offline/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5limu9/taushet_usb_monero_cold_wallet_generator_release/\n\nFor the GUI, you can follow this comprehensive guide:\n\nhttps://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/05/01/monero-gui-wallet-guide/\n\nGenerally it's considered best practice to keep the majority of your fund in cold wallets and some spending funds in a hot wallet. \n\nLastly, VMs protect the host from getting infected, not the other way around. Thus, if there is malware on the host, it'd be able to steal any data from the VM as well. """

But if you have any malware on your computer, this could be dangerous.\n\n2. The safest way to achieve this is to boot onto a Linux Pendrive USB stick (boot into the LiveCD mode only, don't install it into the USB stick), install the Monero CLI, then disable network access either from the menus or \npreferably by using a hardware 'airplane mode' switch on your laptop. You need to discover your view key by typing the command 'viewkey'. Then you need to export the 'key images' for your funds, so that you can detect if they've been spent. Copy the viewkey and the key images onto a second USB stick. Then reboot into a fresh Linux Pendrive USB stick and this time install Linux onto the USB stick so that it retains its state. You'll need a high performance USB stick like the Sandisk Extreme Pro. Then install the Monero CLI or Monero GUI onto this computer and then create a view only wallet using the viewkey and key images. What do you mean this is too complicated? Instructions for doing this are here: https://www.monero.how/how-to-verify-your-monero-funds-with-a-private-view-key\n\n3.

I think we will see a 1 million dollar bitcoin before we see a 1 dollar bytecoin. \n\nGuys feel free to correct my math, doing this quick with google. And I'm not trying to be mean about this at all. I would say a 1cent bytecoin is possible in the near future. I would even say 4 cents a bytecoin by next summer. Much more than that would mean something really amazing has to happen."""

To some people, the privacy aspects of Monero are why they use the coin. It's the be all and end all. To others, the privacy enables something else. Fungibility.\n\nNow Monero can be used like actual cash, but in the digital form. Bitcoin cannot do this, no other altcoin can do this. Monero is the first (and so far only to my knowledge) digital currency that can be used as cash. This, in itself, will be enough for many to jump on board. Even if they don't care at all for the privacy technologies that make the fungibility happen. And that's ok.\n\nMonero is really the coin for everybody. And its privacy features, while awesome in an of themselves, enable so much more. So we shouldn't talk down on the people that want to use Monero for regular everyday use and aren't afraid to use identifying information for it. I'm one of those people. :) """

61,"b'Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman predicts untraceable digital... ""monero"" in 1999'",18,"b""[ Transcript [from interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2mdYX1nF_Y) ]\n\nYou're asking a very complicated question. I think there are two reasons to be optimistic. One is that ideas have changed. The rhetoric 50 years ago was very different from the rhetoric now. Fifty years ago the rhetoric was that everybody was a socialist. All intellectuals were socialists; they all believed that government was the answer to every problem. Today, nobody believes in socialism if you listen to them. That's the rhetoric. \n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; The reality is that we are much less free now than we were 50 years ago. Government is bigger, takes a larger fraction of our income. It imposes more controls on us. We are freer in some dimensions. There's been great social progress -\n intolerances, minorities, our racial problems have been much improved - not through government, but through private activity. Nonetheless, that rhetoric is having its effect. There has been a reduction in government price and wage regulation - the kind of thing - the deregulation of airlines, the deregulation of communication. But what we have tended to do is to replace that by social regulation. The aid to disability, the OSHA, OSCE - that kind of environmental thing. So the question is will the rhetoric--will the change in intellectual ideas--carry through and produce a change in actual policy? \n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; I think there is a tendency for that, that's one source of optimism, but I think a much more reliable source of optimism is the growth of the internet. **In your area, the major effect of the internet will be to make it harder for government to collect taxes. Governments can collect taxes best on things that don't move. Land is an ideal basis of taxation because you can't take it away.** Individual states cannot go as far in taxing personal income as the federal government can, because people can move from one state to the other more easily than they move across countries. The internet is going to make it very difficult to collect taxes on services of all kinds. After all, you can complete these transactions in cyberspace not on the ground. Computer companies now are getting their programming done in India. I doubt that anybody's paying any taxes on any of that. \n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; So that I think that the internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. **The one thing that's missing, but that will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash. A method whereby on the internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A. The way in which I can take a twenty-dollar bill and hand it over to you, and there's no record of where it came from and you may get that without knowing who I am. That kind of thing will develop on the internet,** and that will make it even easier for people to use the internet. Of course it has its negative side. It means that the gangsters, the people who are are engaged in illegal transactions, will also have an easier way to carry on their business. But I think that the tendency to make it harder to collect taxes will be a very important positive effect of the internet."""

61,"b'Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman predicts untraceable digital... ""monero"" in 1999'",4,"b'So, what do you guys think about advocating for a different tax system? (tax ""land"" and not ""capital"" or ""wages"", i.e. tax natural resources, not income)\n\nIt seems most people in this space (digital currencies) seem to fall into 2 camps:\n\n* They want *no taxes*, i.e. to abolish/minimize the state a la anarchists/libertarians (to which the response is ""what about the services government provides?""); or\n* They want digital currencies to be traceable, trackable, taxable to fit into the existing system for taxing incomes (to which the response is ""what about privacy?"" and just give your view keys)\n\nI\'ve not heard much about a 3rd option:\n\n* We could advocate to stop taxing ""income"" and move to taxing ""land value"" - Instead of trying to create better systems of tracking everyone, we should push for more fair taxation, i.e. tax the ""land value"" - it\'s progressive (greater tax on the wealthy, if you *use more resources* then you pay more), it\'s more efficient (lower [dead-weight-loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss)), it\'s less cheat-able (can\'t hide land, no longer relies on honest reporting/totalitarian surveillance), etc.\n\n**Private currencies (Monero) are like the perfect opportunity/excuse to start advocating to change the tax system.**\n\nIt seems most people are just unaware of this ""solution"" and try to fit this new innovation (private money) into the status quo and they either try to find better ways to tax incomes, or yell about abolishing the state completely. Between these extremes, I think advocating for LVT is a better answer. My thinking is private money (Monero?) should go hand-in-hand with advocating for moving from income tax to a land value tax, since it will be impractical to continue to monitor everyone\'s income and it avoids the extremes of abolishing the entire state and the totalitarian nightmare of tracking everyone and everything on an open ledger.\n\n**TLDR; You don\'t have to abolish the state, and you don\'t have to track everyone everywhere. Just encourage private transactions and [tax ""land value""](http://kaalvtn.blogspot.com/p/index.html)**\n\nCheck out these visuals:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/cwCWm'"

Anything completely legal but always shut down by Paypal and other CC processors. \n\nI bet I could get the shapeshift.io button integrated for a few hundred dollars, and figure out some sort of wallet system. \n\n\nI really love the idea of ""Accept all currencies, only pays out in Monero"" because that would increase prices/utility of Monero while pushing out the bad coins. :) Basically some version of greshams law. \n\n\nmy marketplace software even imports products from eBay, Etsy, Amazon**, allows you to buy your own shipping label for the orders, and has features like affiliate program, internal messaging system, and integrates with facebook advertising, Google shopping and so on. \n\nI\'d like to hear people\'s thoughts on this. \n'"

The managers of the marketplace would be the first ones in such an organization, and i can imagine that people want to get listed on there that can deliver speeches or consultancy in this field.\n\nThis way the marketplace curators can also have a commission on sales because they work for the embassy.

At least it gives you some error (or a more accurate 'loading screen') to go off of, instead of 'things aren't happening for idk why'\n\nThis could at the very least open the console window. I'm constantly seeing new Monero users confused syncing mostly due to not knowing what is happening, even though Daemon prints great error logs the Monero GUI seems to ignore them, rendering them completely useless. I'd bet the majority of these issues would resolve themselves if users were given the opportunity to read the errors without having to search for a log location or know a specific application to run. (monerod.exe)\n\nBut thank the lord for the 'Custom Decorations' support. Who could live without that slick title bar? Everyone..\n\nAll joking, bitching, and moaning aside.. Best of luck, hope you get it going! :D\n\nAfter sync I have had no issues using Monero, but instead of making me feel better about it, I just wonder why the botched startup process when it seems to implement less GUI would do them a favor? Just show the console for the one time you'll have to sync massive amounts of data so you can see what errors, if any, are present. Further sync could hide the console and would create far less problems for users. \n\nI'd rather the beta look bad and work great, than the other way around. I personally don't see any benefit in a nice looking 'custom' UI when I end up having to bypass it and using consoles to do the important (and simple) things or figure out what error is happening since it's apparently a GUI feature to hide critical errors.\n\nIts like if windows gave us a desktop and then told us to start programs using Run.exe\nI guess, if you feel like responding to questions and problems where +90% are just syntax and the presence or absence of white space. \n\nOr if you like pointing dozens of users to the same log files, just hide error messages and you'll save the day for dozens of users who could've saved themselves.  \n\nI'll say it for you.\nSTFU KAPPER\n\n\nTL;DR\nTo change the blockchain directory, use the following as a Daemon startup flag.\n\n--data-dir D:\\stuff\\things\\places\\blockchainfolder\n\nRun Monerod.exe to see the console progression or errors related to syncing in real-time.\nFound where you extracted the Monero GUI Beta """

On #monero, you\'re likely to get your answers quickly as there\'s always someone knowledgeable around. Also, [StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com/) is an awesome resource.\n\n>Like Bitcoin, Monero is an open-source cryptocurrency founded & maintained by a group of seven developers & led by one Nicolas van Saberhagen (a pseudonym like \xe2\x80\x9cSatoshi Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nIt was founded by thankful_for_today who forked Bytecoin code to launch Bitmonero fairly. Bytecoin was first CryptoNote implementation, and CryptoNote is just the tech - invented by Nicolas van Saberhagen.\n\nOh, and the Monero project was even forked (the codebase was forked, continuing the same blockchain) away from thankful_for_today due to dispute with the community.\n\nFor more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6oj0be/is_there_away_to_check_moneroj_rich_list/dkhq9d5/\n\n>Untraceability \xe2\x80\x94 For Any Transaction All Senders Are Equiprobable\n\nRather confusing way to explain groups as you make it look like there\'s a pre-determined group of people who **receive**. In fact, stealth addresses perfectly hide the recipient.\n\nStealth addresses are on the output side of transaction.\n\nRing signatures are on the input side of transaction.\n\nEach ring gathers 1 real output (one-time key) and picks a few random ones for diversion to make a ""ring"". Anyone in the ring is equally probable to be the **spender**. And by ""anyone"" it doesn\'t mean a person - but a random one-time key in the ring, which can\'t be linked to a person to begin with (stealth addresses).\n\nSo it\'s not really peer-2-group but apparent group-2-peer.\n\n>True anonymity requires creating a different wallet address for every transaction \xe2\x80\x94 obviously this proves inconvenient. \n\nEven then, it\'s hardly ""true anonimity"" as anyone can see which other addresses you combine with any known addresses of yours and follow the trail back and forth.\n\n>Since most Bitcoin users maintain a single wallet for repeated transactions, it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly easy to prove linkability; meaning computationally feasible to prove that any two transactions (X & Y) went to the same receiver (address). \n\nActually, not really. I could use my Bitcoin HD wallet and generate 1 address for you and 1 for Joe. You\'d have no clue that the other address is mine. Only when I would spend (and if I combine both those addresses on the input side) could you see they\'re both mine.\n\nHowever, if I publish my Bitcoin address and ask for donations, anyone can see what arrives. With Monero, nobody can tell whether an address has received something as the funds will reside on one-time keys which can\'t be linked to an address. Exception is if I publish my viewkey, in which case anyone can monitor inputs (but not spends).\n\n>Monero tackles linkability by creating a blockchain of transactions displaying one-time public addresses, instead of a blockchain of transactions displaying reusable wallet addresses.\n\nThis is ok, but please avoid to say ""one-time public address"". It\'s not an address, it\'s a public key, and saying address it\'s easy to confuse with wallet address.\n\n>a payment verification structure where individuals in a group can all independently verify that the group received a payment without revealing who specifically received said payment. Incoming transactions for the same recipient are sent to multiple one-time public keys (not directly a unique address) & only the recipient can recover the corresponding private part to redeem his funds (using his unique private key). \n\nalmost there :) the group doesn\'t verify that something was received. The group is only used as a hiding place when **spending**.\n\nThink of one-time keys as pots. Instead of walking over to just 1 pot which is mine to take the coin I want to spend, I arrange 5 pots (1 mine + 4 random of others) for display and put my hand into all of them. I can actually grab from only 1 which is mine, but the observer can\'t tell from which one I got the coin when I open my hand in front of the network since i put my hand in all of them.\n\nNote that I can\'t take from the same pot twice thanks to key images. Think of it as unique paint mark left on my palm when taking from the pot. If I grab again from the same one, the mark will be the same, and network will reject it as a cheat attempt. However, nobody can tell which pot makes which kind of mark.\n\nPhew...'"

We\xc2\xa0do\xc2\xa0show our own faces and linkedin profiles\xc2\xa0on the front page\xc2\xa0of our exchange. Yes, it is possible that people are just using the identities of others. We are obviously not so prominent or famous but I do have a number of fairly prominent people in crypto who could vouch for us or who have met us including general partners at Pantera Capital, Jackson Palmer, originator of Dogecoin, Robert CEO of ZenCash, Zooko from Zcash and many others. I know these aren\'t necessarily the gods of crypto like Vitalik Buterin, but I havent met him so he can\'t say if I\'m a real person or not. I am one of the organizers of the SF Advanced Crypto Asset Trading group and Crypto Underground meetup, so 3500 people in that community know who I am at some level. Anyhow, I welcome the suspicion, I hate scammers as much as anyone and feel like everyone who asks you to ""send bitcoin to this address"" deserves to be checked out. I\'ve been in Silicon Valley for 25 years working in tech.\xc2\xa0\n\nCheck out our Linkedin here\nMiko (me)\xc2\xa0https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikomatsumura/\nTalip\'s linkedin is here\xc2\xa0https://www.linkedin.com/in/talipozturk/\nYasin\'s\xc2\xa0https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasin-tamer/\nAhmed\'s\xc2\xa0https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmet-alptekin/\nIsmael\'s\xc2\xa0https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismaelkose/\n\nTalip created the open source project Hazelcast.\xc2\xa0https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast\xc2\xa0a github based Apache open source licensed project with over 24,000 commits and 143 committers.\n\nEvercoin Domain Name\nLet me explain the domain name. We originally launched under the name ""Hazelcoin"" because the founder Talip Ozturk previously created the open source project Hazelcast. We decided that this was not a great name for us, so we did some searching for a good name.\n\nWe ended up liking the name ""Evercoin"" because we feel like there are too many people in this space thinking short-term. We would like to create a built-to-last company and service. So ""Ever"" is a nice feel, like forever feeling, and trustworthy, which we feel is important. The domain was for sale on Sedo.com and we purchased the domain through them. So the domain existed in the past, but it was for sale. We liked the fact that the domain ended in ""coin"".\n\nHonestly, we are a BRAND NEW service, so there are very few reviews.\xc2\xa0\nHere is us on Product Hunt\nhttps://www.producthunt.com/posts/evercoin\nHere is our Blog\nhttps://blog.evercoin.com/\n\nWe need to get more reviews. it will take time to become a trusted and reliable member of this community, we get it.

Please don't forget to mention my co-authors... this is a joint academic effort. The authors on the paper are Tim Ruffing, Sri Aravinda Krishnan Thyagarajan, Viktoria Ronge and Dominique Schr\xc3\xb6der.\n\n2. Don't get too excited. The computational effort is still O(n) and not O(log n) as mentioned in the dev meeting summary (n is the ring size). This means that the signatures are indeed much more compact for larger ring sizes BUT the computation time required to verify them is similar to the time that the current RingCT would need for large size . So it's not possible to scale to ring sizes such as 100k+. One needs to see what ring sizes are reasonable but I assume a reasonable ring size is certainly below 1000, and probably also below 100.\n\n    Still, the improvement in terms of transaction size is tremendous given that space in the blockchain is a very scarce resource and can help Monero scale to larger rings than currently used. \n\n3. We're confident that our idea works but it still needs some scrutiny and peer review (by the academic community as well as by the  dev community).  We hope to be able to release the paper soon."""

The Original Bytecoin developers just have not cared to reply back on their propaganda in the article. What this boils down to is that the emission rate of Bytecoin started off to them as ""extremely high"", but the fact is that it was different from all other coins and the emission rate from mining slowly decreases with time. Making it more valuable. For me, I just got into cryptocurrencies his year and I missed out on Bitcoin early on and Bytecoin as well. What\'s he difference to me of who premined or is mining. I could only jump on to mine one I found out. Still Bytecoin has stood the test of time and growing now anyway. \n\nOn the white paper stuff, they spend so much time on a signature and totally ignored the pure genius of the content of the white paper. If people actually read it them selves and have read the Bitcoin white paper, they would see that it was as revolutionary as the Bitcoin white paper. The dev team just continues to code and let their code speak for them. We now have a growing community and it will moon for sure over the years. I just now got on to the Bytecoin community dev team and we don\'t mind being public and the original and core dev team has decided to remain anonymous just like satoshi, but they are still around. I would just say to people that they can believe the propaganda if they want. Or they can judge for themselves. Also, I must state that I am not against Monero.

If you're new to Monero, please take a few minutes to learn WHY Monero is different :)""",37,"b'I\'ll hijack sgp\'s top quality thread to share my favourite copy-pasta for when someone asks ""what is the use-case for Monero?"":\n\n>1. You are travelling through parts of a country with a medium to high violent crime rate. You need to use some of your Bitcoin to pay for something. If every person you transact with knows exactly how much money you have, this is a threat to your personal physical safety.\n\n>2. You are a business that receives a payment from a supplier. That supplier will be able to see how much money your business has, and therefore can guess at how price sensitive you are in future negotiations. They can see every single other payment you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever received to that Bitcoin address, and therefore determine what other suppliers you are dealing with and how much you are paying those suppliers. They may be able to roughly determine how many customers you have and how much you charge your customers. This is commercially sensitive information that damages your negotiating position enough to cause you relative financial loss.\n\n>3. You are a private citizen paying for online goods and services. You are aware that it is common practice for companies to attempt to use \xe2\x80\x98price discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 algorithms to attempt to determine the highest prices they can offer future services to you at, and you would prefer they do not have the information advantage of knowing how much you spend and where you spend it.\n\n>4. You sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered \xe2\x80\x98tainted\xe2\x80\x99 and that others will refuse to accept them as payment.\n\n>Monero solves these privacy issues by automatically applying privacy techniques to every single transaction made. You can have confidence that it is not possible to own ""tainted"" Monero. This is a concept in economics known as ""fungibility"" and is historically considered an important characteristic for any currency to have.\n'"

16,b'The Web Wallet release!',0,"b""STOP!!  Who is BCN_official?  Is there a name and address associated with this guy? Is Mrs Jenny endorsing him? The reason is because he is the one that put out this .money address first.  I have looked at a few security issues that are not show stoppers but are severe concerns:\n\nQUOTE: \n\nA few red flags that I see with this wallet for any investor at all, new or old. When I take apart the programmer of a software whom is claiming to be in my best interest there are a few things that I look at. I look at it from the point of view as if I were going going to personally scam you :)\nFirst: the choice of a .money domain extension appears cute in the beginning but in reality it is not tracked by the ICANN origanization so a whois lookup on the domain name is not possible. Normally for a good intentioned organization, the revelation of their whois data is not secret. This may or not have been intentional but when coupled with other flags it is significant. If you do a whois lookup of bytecoin.org you will also find that it is disguised by a proxy name. So no leads as to who registered or owns the domain.\nNext, I created an account super fast. There is nothing linking my ownership to the account except my username and password. The programmer did not make any effort to apply required password policies or username policies. I used a very weak password and was granted a wallet. So they are leaving you open to your own demise. It is known that when you give users a choice, they will chose the most convenient security possible.\nThey allowed me to create a wallet address via the website. Like most wallets and exchanges. This means that the API for Bytecoin is directly connected to the website. Not Good. I understand that it is for convenience but a sever no no.\nThere is also no chance for me to encrypt my wallet. It may be done so using my account password, but who knows.\n2FA is not required. It is available, but at first glance it looks like I can do what I want without it.\nI do not see any method for me to acquire the Secret Key. This means that the wallet belongs to the holder of the Secret Key which means that the holder owns your money. Since we can not identify any individual except Jenny whom is associated with this coin or wallet, we have no idea who owns the money. From all perspective, it looks like Jenny is the fall-guy. She is the only person partially identified in the whole system.\nBytecoin.org is using a SSL Certificate issued by COMODO while bytecoin.money is using one issued by Let's encrypt. The first SSL cert costs money to acquire. The second, not. It does not mean that your transaction query is less secure, it only means there is no human on the other end of a certificate.\nThis is just my first 10min glance at this organization and website. Given so much effort to stay anonymous and a wallet which is also anonymous, I would not keep my money here or anywhere with these guys. There is no reason for me to go deeper to find if the COMODO is a shared certificate, if so what other websites are using it? Where is the master server located, where is the wallet server located and all of the other fun research that can be done. This first cursory inspection already reveals that they do not want you to know who they are. Might be another Mount Gox.\n\nUNQUOTE\n\nSo if this is an official BCN wallet form bytecoin.org, where is it listed on their website? Who is endorsing it?  If it is an official wallet, why is it not listed on bytecoin.org and why is the timeline not updated? This is very suspicious and at the least we should at least hold until clarified."""

Personally, I can see BCN getting up into the 10 cent to 20 cent price range in no time!\n\nThere has been a whole lot of new activity in the Bytecoin community as of late. It\'s  probably a reaction from one of the many articles and videos I\'ve seen mocking the Bytecoin team in the recent past, for being indifferent, and for being ""out of reach"" for average Bytecoin users. Truth be told, the Bytecoin staff haven\'t come out and said it yet, but in essence they are ""Rebranding"" Bytecoin over the next month here... They\'ve laid low for a long time, but not anymore! Bytecoin suddenly has a ""new"" roadmap, a new mobile wallet, new chat boards, a burgeoning following, a new transparent approach and an obvious blatent push to connect with their users, and BCN is also about to be available on the 3 largest Crypto Exchanges by October 1st! Rebranding has already done wonders for PIVX and NEO (remember ""Antshares""?), and LISK hasn\'t even rebranded yet, and is already going up on the mere threat of being re-branded! When the word gets out with this unofficial ""re-branding"" effort, about how useful BCN really is,  this coin is gonna fly!\n\nHere are some other useful facts about Bytecoin that most investors don\'t  know:\n* Bytecoin is the second oldest cryptocurrency, only after Bitcoin!\n* Bytecoin has been around for a very long time (Since 2010, I believe).\n* It is/was the original ""Privacy"" Cryptocoin!\n* Monero is surprisingly a FORK of Bytecoin.\n* Bytecoin is the CHEAPEST and easiest to mine of the ""Privacy"" Coins.\n* Bytecoin payments are truly anonymous, and are usually received within 2 minuntes!\n\nThis coin has done remarkably well despite being ignored by the Bytecoin design team for many years now, and actually reached 8th Largest Crypto Market Cap back in June of this year (it currently ranks 26th)! Bytecoin stands poised for bigger and better things in the future, and I for one, will be investing HEAVILY!\n'"

This is relative to your post in two ways.  \n\nFirst, mobile wallets must be coded from scratch which takes time and an understanding of the Monero codebase. There are multiple implementations currently underway and very close (guessing <2 months out).\n\nThe second point is that privacy has a cost.  In the case of Monero, it is a larger transaction size.  To help offset this, Monero has higher fees.  Do you need absolute privacy to buy coffee?  Probably not.

If you have an integrated address, it will consist of a public view key, a public spend key, and a payment id.\n\nAnyone can look at two integrated addresses and tell whether they're just the same wallet addresses with different payment ids.\n\nWhen someone sends to an integrated address, the payment id is encrypted. This means no one can observe that the payment id has been used on the blockchain. They also cannot tell which Monero address has been sent to.\n\nSo the only privacy problem with integrated addresses is that you might not realize that two different integrated addresses, if someone sees the addresses themselves, are linked. Again, they can only tell this from looking at the integrated address, not by looking at the blockchain.\n\nSubaddresses, which have already been implemented in the CLI and will be released to production after security review and testing, will go one step further and make it so that two different subaddresses cannot be observed, by looking at the wallet addresses, to be associated with the same wallet.

Even still users could rely on stealth addresses to remain private. He is right in that each coin has privacy tradeoffs, but Monero is so far ahead of any of its competitors due to stealth addresses, ring signatures, and confidential transactions that there is no question right now what cryptocurrency gives you the highest level of privacy for your transactions, and in fact is the only fungible coin out there due to the level of privacy given to *every* transaction.

Not even to mention, that having no imprint on a website is illegal in most western countries.\n\n2. Their entire FAQ and Terms on the website is one copy of LocalBitcoins.

2,b'MyMonero issues',1,"b""Yes, this is because you need a bit extra to account for the transaction fees. You can calculate an estimate here: https://www.monero.how/monero-transaction-fee-calculator\n\nSo, if you have 0.8 XMR in your wallet, you can't send 0.8 XMR to a different wallet, because then you wouldn't be able to pay for the fees. I know this is very cumbersome, especially for people (like me) who like to have nice round numbers.\n\nThe real solution is to use the official Monero software on your computer, and regenerate your MyMonero wallet there. In MyMonero, if you go to Account Details, you can see your public address and private keys. With these, you can regenerate your MyMonero wallet on your own computer with the official Monero wallet software, monero-wallet-cli. This allows you to access the same wallet both via MyMonero.com and via your own computer. The advantage of using monero-wallet-cli on your own computer, is that you can use the `sweep_all` command. That allows you to send all your XMR to a different address, automatically witholding just the right amount of fees, so that you end up with exactly 0 XMR left.\nIf you want to go this route, this involves downloading the Monero software, and either letting it sync to the blockchain, which takes a lot of time, or using a remote node. See the link on top of this subreddit how to do that.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not seen a `sweep_all` function in MyMonero. The best thing would be if /u/fluffyponyza could add a little functionality to MyMonero, that would let you enter 'all' under 'Amount' when you try to send funds, to activate the `sweep_all` function."""

13,b'Alternatives to a paper wallet for long-term storage',1,"b""I think you misunderstand how hardware wallets work. \n\n>Hardware wallet. I think this is about as secure as flash storage, since that's what I think your data is stored on. \n\nNot quite. Encrypted and the keys are not actually accessible via USB. All the signing is done on the device itself, no keys are exposed to the USB port like they would be if just stored on a flash drive. \n\n\n>But there's an additional problem with the hardware wallet given that as a security measure your data may be wiped after entering the wrong password in several times consecutively. If someone got access to your hardware wallet, they could wipe the data.\n\n\n\n> Of course, if someone got access to any other physical media, they could destroy it or replace the original with a fake copy. The difference here is that you data could be destroyed on the device without you knowing it. It seems unlikely but it's important to be paranoid regarding security.\n\nThis is why you have a seed. If someone steals my hardware wallet or I break it, that is no problem so long as I have access to my seed words. """
13,b'Alternatives to a paper wallet for long-term storage',1,"b'In the end it\'s all about keeping the seed.\nIf you copy the seed in writing like 3 or 4 times, then you can be certain that you didn\'t make mistakes when copying.\nBut a paper is easily lost, stolen or destroyed so I wouldn\'t put my trust in a simple piece of paper. \n\nKeeping it in the cloud, even encrypted, feels too dangerous for me. It\'s like keeping a safe in the open. When someone sees a safe one assumes it contains precious things and will try to break it. Encryption can eventually be broken. \n\nIn my opinion, for paranoid mode, the best way is to use old school spy techniques from before computers + put your ""encrypted"" seed that doesn\'t look encrypted and doesn\'t look like a seed in a place where no one is going to look. Can be in any uninteresting text document for exemple. Can be a fake use notice for a toaster or anything you want. Or a poem. \nThis + an encrypted USB key you can keep in a safe as a safety net because you never know, you could forget how to decrypt your seed.\n+ learn your seed by heart. Learning 25 random words in the correct order is not too complicated, there are techniques to do this. \n\n'"

13,b'Alternatives to a paper wallet for long-term storage',1,"b""How about this option?\n\nBuy a cheap computer, a few hard drives, and a flash drive. Wipe out the computer and install some Linux distribution. Uninstall any networking software: after doing this, this computer will never again be connected to any network. Make a partition in the flash drive with just enough space to store signed bitcoin transactions and/or private keys to make sure nothing malicious gets into the flash drive partition you'll be using (you can set all the bits in the unused partition to zero, and make sure they stayed that way before you plug it into the isolated computer). You can also wipe out the flash drive and redo the partitions every time you move things from/to the isolated computer to/from a computer connected to the network. Setup a RAID array in the isolated computer and encrypt it. Create a difficult pass phrase you can memorize to break the decryption. The RAID software will notice when data is corrupted or when a hard drive fails; since data was stored redundantly, you'll be able to recover the data and fix the corrupted file or replace the broken hard drive. The downside is that you'll have to be replacing hard drives periodically as they degrade. You'll also have to replace computer parts that degrade or even buy a new computer after a few years. If you have enough money stored in the isolated system it may be worth the trouble and expenses.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of floods, fires, earthquakes, or someone stealing your computer.

13,b'I was under the impression Monero would avoid the problem of paying 20+ dollars in fees?',4,"b'I use default fee and ringsize 10 and I pay 0.015XMR fee which is about 1.5$. You can pay 1/4 that if you use low-priority. For me, it\'s still acceptable. It\'s not Monero\'s fault that price did an x3 in a short time and now fees are expensive =)\n\nBut yeah, it\'s definitely  something to discuss, and people downvoting you are probably afraid for their ""investment"" if anything seemingly bad makes it to the top. I disagree with this approach, we need to look for ways to solve our problems and not push them under the rug. It\'s solving problems which makes us progress. But many people want fixes ""tomorrow"" and it\'s just not reasonable. It\'s a long ride.\n\nFees will go down even if we do nothing:\n\n- Price could do a pull-back (I don\'t think anyone wants this, except some traders)\n- Usage could increase, lifting the blocksize to, like, consistent 600kB which would halve the fee (I think everyone wants this)\n- Block reward is going down all the time. It won\'t take too long to halve (I think) and it will also halve the fee (in terms of XMR) but may increase the price (in terms of USD, and with it the fee), who knows.\n\nNow, fees are not consensus rules. Even now, if like 20% of nodes would allow smaller fees, you\'d have a realistic chance of having those (< current min.fee TX-es) enter into a block if a miner picks them up.\n\nIt\'s not so simple with Monero to find a good way for fees. Sure, we say ""dynamic..."" but seems like market acts too fast. The fees are currently set as a compromise between them being high enough to push the blocksize up and what was seen as acceptable. ""Problem"" is the price went wild since then =)\n\nAnyways, there\'s a range proof optimization in the pipeline, which would reduce TX size for 50% and with it the fees.\n\nBut yeah, wouldn\'t hurt to discuss some other approach to wallet fee settings. I\'d vote for reducing min. fee, but have wallet do something ""adaptive"" so the fees could rise high enough in case of congestion to make the miners bump up the blocksize. Also, I was pondering some kind of discounted block penalty for this boot-strapping phase we\'re still in, but then we opted for a simpler solution to just increase the min. blocksize to 300kB (back in March/April). See [here](https://github.com/JollyMort/monero-research/blob/master/Monero%20Dynamic%20Block%20Size%20and%20Dynamic%20Minimum%20Fee/Monero%20Dynamic%20Block%20Size%20and%20Dynamic%20Minimum%20Fee%20-%20DRAFT.md) for more info.\n\n/u/enceladu nothing wrong with 600kB bump IMO, but there could be other, more ""long-term"" ways to address this. Once Monero will grow big enough, this constant of 300kB or 600kB would become meaningless if regular use is keeping blocks elevated at something like 3MB :) It\'s just a safety-net, this min. blocksize thing.'"

I\'ll try to clear the issues, I hope I\'ll manage with that.\nTo begin with bytecoin.money is an official web wallet which was made by our devs together with the community, indeed. \n\nHowever, all the security moments were tested only by the devs during the whole process. The only reason we didn\'t put it on the website is reconstruction of it, however, we made the posts on all the official channels that bytecoin.money is our official wallet.\n\n\nFurther moments:\n\nIdentity. Are you kidding? How does the fully anonymous coin can contain any identities. Your example about the banks doesn\'t work at all. It really doesn\'t matter if the ""Super-public-guaranteed-bank"" has some CEO\'s and other personalities. They can\'t avoid all the risks. If someone (government, CEO, etc.) who has any options with the money wants to steal a part, he\'ll make it. It\'s all the psychology, there are no guarantees in cryptocurrency at all. It is your choice of whom to trust, indeed.\n\nServer and domain. Same as above. You only have to mention that we wouldn\'t release until we were sure the wallet and the whole infrastructure is secured.\n\n2FA. There\'s a group of users who can\'t stand 2FA and prefer a secured password created by themselves. 2FA is an option that you can (or have to, yours truth) choose right after your first log in.\nThe only point where I\'ll agree with you is the list of options to make the wallet more secured. That\'s why we don\'t dispute when a member of the community is telling that it is a beta-version. However, it supposed to be a great beta, isn\'t it? All of the features (private key, backup file, etc.) will be released in further versions. I think you don\'t even imagine the scales of work we did (and doing now) to make the wallet so fast and stable. \n\nAgain, before spreading this type of scam panic make sure your arguments are quite serious. I don\'t actually care the way you make your speech, however, I strongly recommend you to know the specific of the exact product you\'re preparing to scam on. Otherwise, making your presentation that way means you\'re ""all-expert"" from a TV-show.\n\nYours truly,\nJenny'"

Bytecoin's ledger really is untraceable when it works correctly and if you want a fully anonymous coin then you need to sacrifice some transparency (in this case the team is choosing to keep their personal lives a secret.)  If you want my 2cents Bitcoin is more of a scam than Bytecoin is right now.\n\nEDIT: If you only came here to tell us that our developer team isn't transparent your not bringing any new information to the tea party and are about the 1e+100'th person to say it."""

There is no feel good community on Earth that can explain these simple security issues away.\n\nSo now we have an ""intent"" problem as we can not figure their intent, but it is not to claim responsibility for your money which you are investing and we have a lack of good security practice. This coin has a long way to go and needs a brand new team to take over.\n\nI am out and never to return. Unless you personally know these guys or can state for a fact why your money is secure in this anonymous wallet, you may want to consider transferring also.\n\nAs another defense for them, I do not personally us this bytecoin.money wallet as I use my own cold systems. In the transferring of my funds out of this wallet, it has taken over 30 minutes to get only 11 confirmations of my transaction request. It would seem to me it was faster before.'"

From their website they appear to have missed their 01 Sept timeline for putting out a web wallet. This Bytecoin.money wallet is highly suspect to be a fake wallet. DO NOT deposit and money into this wallet until it is endorsed from the Bytcoin.org website.

8,b'New section! Your questions to the dev team. Sep. 13 - Sep. 20',6,"b'Please let me address some points which, I think, deserve your attention :\n\n- Openness : all rumors about the devs team being, ermmm, ""shady"" must arrive to an end. There are a lot of threads out there talking about the genesis of Bytecoin and they\'re not too flattering. Think the ""real"" story about Nicholas Van Saberhagen and his ""misteriously signed"" whitepaper should be taken to light.\nIn addition, I think, a true point of contact with devs and at least a front man who shows his face should be considered as an indisputable need.\n\n- Team Contacts and announcements : we all know about the recent bug discovered in CryptoNote (May 2017) which allowed someone to create 63 millions of bytecoin out of thin air (Apr 2017 - https://minergate.com/blockchain/bcn/block/1243471). I am not here to argue about the patch correction made to the core but I can not forget the comment about Jenny instructing Poloniex to accept valid transactions only after 150 confirmations. \nThus I would like to know: when such an exploit should occurr again which are the entities to get in touch with ? Who is addressed to be the first contact for ringing alarms ? \nIs there any monitoring/auditing environment which could render as publicly available the state of the network ? How many nodes have been upgraded after the patch has been published ? Are we under the Damocles sward of a possible fork due to unpatched nodes distribution ?\nMore ... this insane fight with Monero in particular with Riccardo Spagni (fluffypony) is detrimental to Bytecoin value: like it or not Monero, by now, is gaining more success than Bytecoin ... so what can YOU do tell the world Bytecoin is trustable just as like as Monero ?\n\n- Infrastructure : my recent days playing around with Bytecoin has brought to my attention an uncommonly high number of complaints about the inability to properly synch their wallets. A further analysis has shown a very poor status of network of nodes which, I guess, is for the most part, relying on self hosted nodes by end users. The lack of a serious network of nodes run by professionals with professional equipment is indeed a must for a blockchain which is reaching fast(1) the level of 40GB in size. Let\'s call \'em for now ""priority nodes"" : they should be listed in seed directory to allow client wallets to directly connect to them for fast synching. Are you studying any kind of strategy that mith keep granting the decentralization of the network with high priority nodes (maybe with a remuneration) and a wide spread of light wallets ?\nIs there any development in progress aimed to reduce the growth rate in size of the blockchain ?\n\n- Hashing Power : even if not directly under control of the devteam I consider the overall hashing power of Bytecoin extremely low. 3.32MH at the time of this writing with Minergate\'s pool detecting roughly 28~30% of power. Monero has 75 times this value with Minergate\'s weight being at roughly 11%.\nIs Bytecoin under hashing control of Minergate ? At a such a wek level of hashing power how we could protect Bytecoin from a 51% hashing attack ?\n\n- Features : I personally think Bytecoin is fantastic for micropayments and wide distribution due to the high number of coins emitted. Tracing keys are great to ""open"" privacy when needed. Thus I really do not get the point of this important step on your roadmap : ""Untraceable Tokens"". What is the point of allowing the creation of Bytecoin based token on a blockchain which have so fragile legs at the moment ?\n\nThank you for your time and patience.\n'"

A lot of people preferred to be paid out in E-Gold and I thought the idea of having a currency based on the weight of Gold was unique, it felt like I was actually holding something of value. \n\nI remember when I had heard about E-Gold being shut down and raided, struck me as odd how they were charged with money laundering and the concept that being paid in anything but fiat currency was strange to me how assets could just be confiscated and the people were not reimbursed. \n\nI do recall during Ron Pauls political run for the 2008 elections that the Liberty Dollar was being promoted as a alt currency, I was big on that bandwagon with the idea that there was nothing actually illegal about creating a currency as long as it wasn\'t misrepresenting it\'s self as a government issued currency. \n\nOnce again, news about the shut down and raid of the Liberty Dollar left me scratching my chin in confusion as to what was going on.\n\nIt wasn\'t until my first exposure to silver rounds around 2010 that I started small time stacking, I didn\'t hear about Bitcoin until probably around 2011 or so and figured it to be mainly underground. \n\nGoing back into privacy, I started exploring proxies and vpn\'s probably around 2002-2003, found out about TOR and I2P around 2006 and thought the concept was amazing. I also read wikileaks in the early days and started to shift my opinion. \n\nNow in the age of technology where everything and anything can be used against you, smart phones are prevalent, cloud computing is a common thing, and peoples assets are out in the open, I think that now is the most important time for privacy. \n\nI can\'t help but wonder how or why people ask ""what do you have to hide"" or ""why would you need this?"" and find it breathtaking. \n\nYou would think with all the data breaches, the verizon metadata scandal, hacks and leaks, major email platforms having their data dumped, and other factors that people would learn to stop putting so much trust and faith into centralized organizations and those who declare themselves of authority without realizing that faith in such is ignorance.\n\nWhat reason should we have to trust other people, based on what principle?

38,b'Privacy Matters (To new people and also old people who are confused)',2,"b'Ironically, I remember I was at work in 2005 with my good friend and coworker at the time, both of us worked for a web hosting company with Information Technology. I remember that this whole concept of ""cloud computing"" didn\'t exist as a marketing term, there were server chassis or storage arrays and redundant DNS to prevent sites from going down, cloud computing did exist but not to the aspect it was being marketed at that time, and there were still weaknesses against DDoS attacks though some expensive boxes DID exist at that time.\n\nMost people were still using flip phones but around 2007, company gave us Blackberry Curve devices. I remember my colleague and I watched a video in 2008 about Microsoft Surface (called PixelSense at the time) before the iPad had ever been known. We had a discussion about some of the major changes to computing, and about the only tablets were microsoft windows tablets where were really just laptops that had a swivel. We had a general idea that devices were likely going to exist that didn\'t use harddrives or require anything other than a internet connection and most data would be stored on a remote server, all that was needed was a fast enough connection. \n\nMy fear about this was that we would lose control over our own data with such technology. There were some experimental remote desktop platforms by some Israeli company I was reading about at the time, and this aspect of storing data remotely, again, all pre-iphone/android/etc. About the most you could do with a remote desktop or data remotely was maybe a virtual dedicated server which was quite laggy, so linux servers were preferred for storage and some sort of control panel interface like cPanel or Plesk, but more for a corporate environment, not for personal use. \n\nWe knew this future would be one of every possible thing but that with convenience, security and privacy would need to likely disappear from the corporate world. The only thing that would remain was the illusion of security and privacy.\n\nLook back to the internet in the 90\'s, you could have a conversation with people (not like today, so many trolls and people who want to cause harm), play a game on some platform like mplayer through 56k, you really felt anonymous and hidden that you could just use some identity that you made up and no fear or consequences for just being curious and wanting to learn. Most of the things I learned were from trial and error, everything from security, going through the .com boom, learning about DNS and running servers, free software, torrents, napster, all of this allowed pioneers to grow. \n\nI can\'t even imagine how many things back then, that were so open, would probably be very illegal today due to legislation. \n\nToday you can\'t even create a rocket and launch it to the moon without being branded some sort of radical terrorist without some crazy money, permission and clearance. \n\nIf you consider regulations and how it has killed the spirit and dreams of what we are capable of, we have seen technology turned into something to fear. \n\nI can\'t even touch facebook because I know every single thing i say will be logged and used against me (not as if Reddit is any better), everything I do is targeted towards me in the form of an advertisement. I remember when Gmail first came out of beta and one of the big controversies was that they were fighting against evil (Microsoft at the time) yet promoting this concept of targeted advertising and unlimited data. What has google become? \n\nLook at cell phones? You can essentially be cut off from the world because everything is centralized, you can pretty much kiss your ability to use your phone goodbye if you end up banned from Play store, App Store, or Amazon. It\'s actually quite anti-consumer and anti-competition if you consider the limitation of choice. Maybe we need blockchain based cellphone operating systems next?\n\nI really believe that Monero will give us the financial freedom we need. Is Monero used for illegal purposes? Absolutely. Do tax evaders use it? I\'m sure they do. Do some of the worst individuals involved in ransomware utilize it to funnel funds? Sure. \n\nAt the same time, the postal service is probably the biggest transit of illegal drugs in the world, i\'m sure Toyota might just be a popular vehicle used by terrorists, perhaps the dollars we hold in our wallets were used by some evil drug trafficker to cause major harm to victims, maybe the very DNA we have in our body is the same DNA that was in a brutal dictator who murdered people? Why does it matter? Monero is simply a tool, a cryptocurrency, it is up to people how they determine they want to use it and if they will abuse it or use it for good. People have a choice and damnit, I want my ability to have the option of keeping my money private regardless if there is a purpose or not! Just fighting for the right is worth it!

11,b'Monero websites - thoughts and improvements',1,"b'Thoughtful post and very much appreciated. As a person on the institutional side of the investment table, I just want to make a few comments. \n\nYou\'re spot on regarding investment limitations per a fund\'s LPA. From my vantage point, though, I am seeing more ""tactical"", ""opportunistic"" allocations of between 1% to 10% of committed capital. More established firms (who are granted this flexibility from their limited partners) have raised funds on the back of having (1) a seasoned and experienced investment team, (2) deploying a consistent investment approach (read: this is different from investment strategy, investment focus, etc.); and (3) generating top decile performance on an absolute basis (versus the public markets) and relative basis (versus their peers). These are the very firms whose funds can be active in the market -- and we\'re seeing a bit of this (e.g. Fred Wilson, Howard Marks (who is somewhat warming up to the ""asset class""), Kyle Bass, etc.). Note: Just above I said ""can be active"" -- some are, some are not (yet), some (well...) we don\'t know.\n\nI tend to disagree (somewhat) with your comment that the less (readily available) information there is about the specific asset, the less likely it is that the money flows in. Though rare, I have seen a $5 million investment closed after spending an hour with a founder (this investment returned approx. $490 million). Talk about not working with a lot of info :) Keep in mind that that is an anomaly. Generally, serious institutional investors perform serious due diligence -- when information is wrapped in a pretty, pink bow they tend to be hesitant. These are big boys and they love to go digging (due diligence)...the more they dig, the more they learn -- which leads to a disciplined and informed investment decision.\n\nJust my two cents. Like I mentioned above, thoughtful post. '"
11,b'Monero websites - thoughts and improvements',1,"b'I would agree that ""Technical spec"" points on the website could use some developing (explication?).

Having said that, I\'m undecided so far and here are some questions/objections not already asked/mentioned in the thread.\n\nPersonally I would rather have a device like a Ledger that is able to secure multiple currencies. I think having to buy a separate Monero wallet will put off a lot of noobs from both a financial and psychological POV. I also would prefer not to carry multiple wallets. Worse, I think the fact that there would be this unique hard wallet option could make these noobs feel even less secure about the current GUI and totally write off Monero. The thinking being, ""if these XMR fans are so concerned about the software wallet that they self-funded a hardware wallet, it must be a really inferior software wallet. ZEC didn\'t have to do this."" \n\nI\'m not saying this conclusion would make any sense, but I think it\'s a distinct possibility that\'s how it would be taken.\n\nAnother objection: At a customs point, an educated agent would possibly be trained to look for a Monero wallet. If he finds mine, so much for anonymity. He may not be able to access it but that would give me little solace when contemplating the situation from jail. (Yes, I realize this is a pretty extreme scenario, but I want to throw it out there).\n\nFinally, isn\'t it possible that Ledger would just abandon their work if this gets funded? Someone said that Ledger is a shitty company. My experience with them has been quite good. They were very fast with both BCash and Segwit implementation (faster than Trezor I believe). OTOH, if they\'re just going to give Monero the run around and constantly tell us ""coming soon"", I\'d be in favor of funding this wallet. Do we have any reliable Ledger update?'"

OTOH, see my other question - whether the random seed is calculated *before* or *after* the tickets are sold and/or the drawing is held.  \n\n- I wonder if xmrlotto.com can control the unique IDs?  The list of tickets (with their IDs / addresses) is published and so is in theory auditable / uncheatable / unmodifiable.  Therefore, I wonder if I can use some 3rd-party/trusted service to retrieve the list published in the past (to double-check that the list hasn\'t been modified after the random seed has been discovered).  Side note: I wondered whether assigning unique ids in a different way would be more robust/fair, but I think it doesn\'t change anything (one idea I had was to sort the lottery tickets based on their payout/target-addresses and then assign IDs based on the sorted order - this would keep the IDs not fullly known until the very end, but I am not sure if this benefits anything...).\n\n- Given Monero\'s anonymity, how can all participants know whether the payment has been issued to the winner?  What if the winner claims that he/she didn\'t get any coins - can xmrlotto.com somehow prove in this case that they are being honest and the payment really did go through?\n\n- Are there any other ""attacks"" that would prevent the lottery from being truly random?'"

0,b'Monero is not very private. The GUI does not even support Tor! And other valid criticisms.',25,"b'1. Yes, having different addresses is important. Not as important since you don\'t need to worry when spending, but you need to worry when receiving. Subaddresses, in PR now, will help with this. Of course, anyone who cares can use multiple accounts now.\n\n2. Check out https://xmr.be. This is a list of nodes people can connect to. Currently, there are 100. Not that many, but I believe that most people currently run a full node given the tech-competent audience. Ultimately, the best privacy is only afforded when running a full node.\n\n3. No, you can use the same wallet to churn. You only need one copy of the blockchain. Yes, most people will probably not go through this effort. However, the impact of churning is still being researched. Your ""7 times"" claim isn\'t really based in fact at the moment. Furthermore, this is only needed with certain use-cases, though they may be common. Expect more research here, but I don\'t think you\'re coming from a valid position since there are no facts.\n\n4. [You can manually run Monero with Tor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/4z3ced/guide_to_using_monero_with_tor_correctly/). You don\'t need native support to do this. We are waiting for Kovri to integrate an anonymous P2P system through the entire network, far exceeding the extend that Tor is used with Bitcoin. We understand the risks of not using a private system, though you still can today.\n\nLet\'s wrap up Bitcoin compared to Monero. Bitcoin:\n\n1. Has all wallet balances public. Monero\'s are hidden.\n\n2. Has transparent linkages between accounts, including these HD wallets. Monero doesn\'t have an HD wallet, but there is no link on the blockchain.\n\n3. Has no benefits whatsoever when churning.\n\n4. Can connect through Tor. With Monero it\'s more difficult, but it can provide the same exact protection.\n\n5. Leaks more data when connected to SPV nodes than Monero to its SPV nodes.\n\nI don\'t think Bitcoin is more private in practice. You have raised some valid concerns, but they aren\'t quantified, and you don\'t actually make any comparison between Bitcoin and Monero.\n\nFurthermore, if you\'re talking about default use, there is no way that Bitcoin users get more privacy than Monero users. An HD wallet + Tor is nothing compared to everything Monero has to hide info on the blockchain. I will defend this vehemently.\n\nWe love having discussions here about how to improve, but it\'s hard to speak with people who claim ""the Monero team has decided that privacy is not really important after all"".'"

They can't figure out how much you own in that wallet address. Best practice is to use a buffer address for all your public facing monero needs.\n\n2. People aren't motivated. They're lazy and impatient. Also, you don't understand how the light node services currently work. They are round robin DNS entries, so while the address is node.moneroworld.com, it currently redirects to a random one out of a list of 18. node.xmr.be resolves to a list of too many that I don't feel like counting or making a fancy grep statement. If you can find yourself to a linux terminal try ```dig node.moneroworld.com``` , or visit this link as indicated on moneroworld.com . http://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/?domain=node.moneroworld.com\n\n3.

The core team decided to go the i2p route. And again, this Ip thing.... an attacker would have to own the entire network. \n\n> So, my point is, that Bitcoin can actually be more much more private than Monero.\n\nYes. Sure. If you buy your bitcoin with cash. And you wear a mask while doing this. Although the guy that sold you the bitcoin knows that some guy in a mask in Tuskaloosa bought these bitcoin. And then the guy that sold the guy in a mask in tuscaloosa some bitcoin can watch that output, and then when the guy in a mask in tuscalusa uses that output, the guy that sold the guy in a mask in tuscaluza some bitcoin can see where the bitcoin went. If its a local shop, the guy that sold the bitcoin can then go hang out at that shop, and keep an eye on the change output. He could wait there all day. And then when he sees the change output being used, he can look around in the shop and see which nimwit is scanning QR codes and explaining to the shop keeper that yeah, block conf sucks, but yah know, its the future. \n\nso its a good thing your IP address was obfuscated.\n\nwhat are the other ways to anonymously obtain bitcoin... lets see. you could mine it. ugh. im too tired and bored to go through it again. good luck!

15,b'Mineshaft - Mining Operations Management | Monero + Javascript = \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80',1,"b'Mineshaft is Javascript + Cryptocurrency for the Desktop, Browser and Server.\n\nThe primary focus is to establish a standard for managing mining operation data. The standard will be used to make sharable data structures, which can be composed with data visualization components. For example, an easy-to-reason about GraphQL schema to perhaps request  hashing averages or total electricity costs for the previous 3 months, which can be passed to D3+VX charts, dendographs, trees, etc...\n\nThe secondary focus is to help abstract away low-level software management for day-to-day mining operators. Developers and Engineers know and love the benefits of Docker - we should share these benefits. To help strengthen the community it might be in our best interest to assidt newcomers and non-technical folks with ready-to-go software environments for code coming from a diverse community of developers.\n\n1. Sharable GraphQL Schema designers and developers can share when building tools for the community.\n2. Automated software deployment for people who aren\'t developers, but want to get involved with cryptocurrency.\n3. C++/WebAssembly for common CPU intensive cryptocurrency appliction tasks. Less code = more secure applications.\n\nIn addition to help facilitate community growth, it would be cool to also technical several fun technical challenges. \n\n# **Premise**\n\n1. Dedicated mining stations should have a minimal operating systems with limited (*if any at all*) interface components.\n\n2. Mining operators might benefit from data structures standardization as it relates data storage and composition with data visuailization components.\n\n3. A decoupled interface/database system for distributed mining station management, across separate networks, separate from the ""logistics"" of computer networking, might provide the infrastructure for securely sharing a ""pure"" representation of ""state"" as agreed upon by the parts or the whole network.\nUltimately I think software should abstract away all technical parts - a computer should be doing those anyways.\n\nA few examples are\n\n1. Mining operators should not have to concern themselves with package management, operating system dependencies and other Engineer specific problems.\n\n2. Mining information (logs, commands, etc...) should be encrypted/decrypted automatically **right** before rendering in the interface (Browser ServiceWorker). Crpyography on ""set it and forget it mode"" like Monero.\n\n3. I actually don\'t know if it has any value, but essentially allowing miners to link up more effectively for ""community"" analytics.\n\n# Mission\n#### Decentralized cryptocurreny mining operations for maimum scalability, security and value creation.\n\n**Scalable**: People First\n\n**Security**: Less Code + More Sharing\n\n**Value**: Distributed Workload + Resource Cycle Loop + Cryptocurrency Infrastructure\n\n\n# Building The Infrastructure\n#### The Mineshaft Infrastructure is 3 divided into Sectors: Desktop, Browser and Server.\n\nEach Sector is responsible for developing Sector specific projects.\n\nAll 3 of the Sector\'s infrastructure are built with Javascript, hence Fullstack Javascript.\n\nEach Mineshaft Sector is responsible to share Javscript/WebAssembly with each other as often as possible. You must find the people who need the code, instead of waiting for people who need it to find the code. Additionally, each Sector (unless designated otherwise) should prioritize sharability over low-level optimization. To better manage CPU intensive processing across devices/platforms, while also maintaining interpolablility, WebAssembly (.wast .wasm) will be used as the compiling target for low-level languages like C++/Rust/Go. To put it simply, we\'re staying in the V8, SpiderMonkey and Chakra playgrounds for safe, portable code across devices and operating systems.\n\n\nRight now the Mineshaft repository is a mono-repo, meaning the Desktop, Browser and Server applications are all together.\n\nhttps://github.com/KamesCG/mineshaft\n\nI welcome anyone to get involved.

Specifically, this means we need to figure out how to properly handle payment IDs and integrated addresses, specifiying mixin, transactions in the mempool (give the appearance of instant receives), fee calculation, sweep all, etc. There are still a lot of things to polish so that the average Exodus user can't tell the difference between the Bitcoin experience, Ethereum experience, and Monero experience. Everything needs to just work, and work the same across all assets. Most of our customers are new to crypto and everything that it brings. So we're incredibly sensitive to the UX of it all.\n\nNow for the good news, you may have heard about us releasing an advanced unsupported version of Exodus called Exodus Eden: https://www.exodus.io/eden/ - what's exciting about Exodus Eden is that the pace of speed that we can move at is much quicker since it's unsupported and there are no links to it from our main page. So we have no fear about breaking things and newbies getting burned. We know many of you can handle these rough edges, so you're going to see Monero in Exodus Eden first. When we're comfortable and can polish up the user experience and integration, we'll move Monero into Exodus.

It fits in the L3 cache (per core) of modern processors, which should become mainstream in a few years;\n2. A megabyte of internal memory is an almost unacceptable size for a modern ASIC pipeline;\n3. GPUs may run hundreds of concurrent instances, but they are limited in other ways: GDDR5 memory is slower\nthan the CPU L3 cache and remarkable for its bandwidth, not random access speed.\n4. Significant expansion of the scratchpad would require an increase in iterations, which in turn implies an overall\ntime increase. \xe2\x80\x9cHeavy\xe2\x80\x9d calls in a trust-less p2p network may lead to serious vulnerabilities, because nodes are\nobliged to check every new block\xe2\x80\x99s proof-of-work. If a node spends a considerable amount of time on each hash\nevaluation, it can be easily DDoSed by a flood of fake objects with arbitrary work data (nonce values).\nOne of the proof-of-work algorithms that is in line with our propositions is CryptoNight. It is designed to make CPU\nand GPU mining roughly equally efficient and restrict ASIC mining.'"

61,"b'Monthly report from yours truly, Sarang Noether'",1,"b""Because the forum system keeps shitting the bed, direct text here:\n\n> It's been my pleasure to start work for the Monero Research Lab as a full-time researcher under a Forum Funding System proposal. This month has seen a flurry of activity regarding new and innovative research to benefit Monero.\n\n> My initial area of work has been in sublinear ring signatures that integrate confidential transactions. The existing ring signatures, known as MLSAG signatures, scale linearly in size with the number of public keys in the obfuscation ring, but verification times are close to optimal with this approach. The inclusion of amount commitments in the scheme does add assurances of the privacy of transaction amounts, but increased privacy of the sender requires correspondingly larger ring sizes. The goal was to investigate signature schemes to replace MLSAG that scale sublinearly with the ring size. A solution, now dubbed StringCT in an admittedly poor attempt to integrate the initials of its designers, allows for confidential transactions while scaling logarithmically in size with the number of keys in the ring. I and the team verified the correctness of the scheme and produced (thanks to knaccc) a working implementation in code. This showed that while signature size is reduced and scales well to very large rings (which benefits sender privacy and reduces bloat), this comes at the cost of increased verification times (which may hinder adoption and widespread use). I will continue to work on optimizations to StringCT, alternative sublinear schemes that may provide better verification times, and any wild new cryptographic approaches to signatures.\n\n> I have also put work into proper and correct implementations of subaddresses. While Monero users have always enjoyed the benefit of recipient anonymity through the use of one-time output keys, maintenance of multiple wallets has been a source of inefficiency. A user may want to publish separate wallet addresses to prevent linking of funding destinations, but this currently requires that she scan each transaction once per wallet to determine if the transaction is destined for one of her wallets. A pull request was made on a solution, presented by kenshi84 and others in a pull request. Using a single master wallet, a user can generate as many subaddresses as he wishes, and publish them separately. Transactions destined for a subaddress still enjoy the privacy benefits of one-time keys. The user only has to maintain a small table of local information to keep track of subaddresses, which cannot be linked to each other or to the master wallet. Further, the user only needs to scan an incoming transaction once to efficiently determine which subaddress, if any, is the destination. The scheme allows for multiple outputs, though at the small cost of an additional transaction public key per output. A whitepaper documenting the scheme has been drafted and is forthcoming after the usual review process.\n\n> Less tangible, but still important, work continues to happen through the Lab's communication channels on IRC. Topics we discuss are often information gathering and planning that finds its way into the codebase or other papers. Discussions included debating fee structures and algorithms (which may see recommendations before the next hard fork), how to address the fate of proof-of-work under the assumption of ASIC developments (in the early stages, with much more research to follow), the balance of ring size versus computational effort (and how this affects churn), and a host of other topics related to Monero's plumbing. I and the other Lab researchers are regularly available for discussions of any issues that arise, and will continue this open approach to our research and development efforts. Expect to see these types of things on the next roadmap as our goals for them become more concrete and better understood in detail.\n\n> Finally, my spare time has been dedicated to the usual reading, study, and literature review that are the blessing and curse of any researcher. I always work to stay abreast of new developments in cryptography and security, and this month has been no exception. This has involved developments in signature schemes, commitment schemes (I am not afraid of commitment), proofs of work and space and stake and secure erasure, bilinear mapping applications to aggregate signatures, and many others. While not every new paper has applications to Monero, an important part of my role in the Lab is to consider the future of Monero from all sides by taking a broad look at cryptographic developments. This dedication to academic research continues to set Monero apart.\n\n> I look forward to continuing with work as documented on our recent roadmap, which I won't reiterate on this post in the interest of space. As stated in the initial proposal, I am extremely grateful to the community for its support of my contributions to the Lab. This support is essential for the ongoing academic research that sets Monero apart in the cryptocurrency world, and I'm excited to continue work each day to the benefit of the project."""

Nobody can see how much money you have or your transaction history (unless you give them a view key which is completely up to you).\n\nWhen you send a Monero transaction, your IP address is visible only to the first node it connects to. IP addresses are not stored on the blockchain. So, the exposure of one's IP address is fairly small, but it's still a risk that is easily fixed by using TOR, I2P, or simply using the wifi at Starbucks (because Starbuck's IP is not your IP).\n\nMonero will be implementing Kovri I2P soon, which will route transactions over I2P by default.\n\nIf someone tells you that an IP address is the holy grail of privacy, they're not very informed. What good would it do to make a transaction over TOR if the details of the transaction are all public, such as with BTC, Verge, or pretty much every other coin? Anyone can still see the transaction amount and the address to which it was sent, plus transaction histories and the account balances of any address.\n\nSo, while an IP address is a piece of the privacy equation, it's a smaller piece. Monero currently takes care of the weightier pieces and the IP piece will be implemented soon. Until then, there's TOR, I2P, VPNs, Starbucks wifi, McDonalds wifi..."""

As more and more blocks get added in front, they ""confirm"" the transactions in the blocks behind them more and more. When you\'re waiting for a payment to have confirmations, you\'re waiting for more and more blocks to be added in front to confirm the blockchain. There are checksums in the blocks that are influenced by the values of the checksums in the blocks before them, so you can mathematically traverse the chain backwards and confirm validity according to the protocols that govern Monero. To inject your crap into the chain, you have to convince the majority of the Monero network to accept the history of the chain and your additions going forward, or else you risk your bogus chain getting pruned in favour of the overwhelmingly verifiable, proper Monero chain.\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHN_B_H_fCs) from getmonero addresses how ring signatures and key images enable privacy and protection of funds.'"

33,"b'Hi Monero crew - while the title of this is on Bitcoin, Monero has a critical part in it that i think you might appreciate (including a discussion and valuation in the epilogue). I hope you enjoy (and also read the whole piece). :) Izzy'",9,"b'Pretty good read! The main monero segmant is at the very end, but probably good to read the entire thing. \n\nHere is a copy paste of it, probably poorly formated, but thought it might be helpful to some people: \n\nMonero Valuation\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t go into great detail here of why I favor Monero as a \xe2\x80\x98Bitcoin Backup\xe2\x80\x99, particularly over other altcoins which also offer privacy features. This is, after all, a treatise on Bitcoin with what I felt to be a necessary addendum addressing privacy. Suffice it to say that in my view Monero has the most favorable combination of privacy features, adoption and ethos to be the best candidate. If this is insufficient for you, then by all means feel free to apply the methodology I use to any alternative privacy enabled coins. Considering the upside potential, even if you were to split the total valuation between the top \xe2\x80\x98contenders\xe2\x80\x99, the ultimate \xe2\x80\x98success\xe2\x80\x99 valuation for\neach would still be hundreds of times (or more) above current prices.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s assume that governments cannot help themselves, and despite knowing that it will in many\nways be unsuccessful, they\nstill announce a ban on Bitcoin and all Cryptocurrencies. As such we anticipate two things for our valuation: 1)\n \nMonero becomes the primary \xe2\x80\x98bearer of the torch\xe2\x80\x99 of\nfixed supply money. \nThis means that we will attribute some portion of global M3 to Monero allocation, similar to what we did with Bitcoin. 2)\n \nGovernments have some success in keeping Monero\xe2\x80\x99s use from becoming as widespread as\na \xe2\x80\x98Bitcoin Success\xe2\x80\x99 scenario.\nIn a \xe2\x80\x98crackdown\xe2\x80\x99 scenario, any investment in Monero would\nlikely be outlawed, and despite enforcement of such a ban being difficult if not impossible (due to its innate privacy features), the prospect of prosecution would likely keep some people away from it. As such\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s assume that\nMonero achieves only a 5% penetration rate in\nits\n success scenario (one where Bitcoin is outlawed). If we stick to our 10-year horizon then all that remains to perform our analysis is a probability estimate of\na global government \xe2\x80\x98crackdown\xe2\x80\x99\n on Bitcoin.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s assume this scenario at 1\n%, and now we can do the math. 5% of an M3 sized at $80 trillion is $4\ntrillion. This would be distributed over (let\xe2\x80\x99s say) a future\nMonero coin supply of 20 million\n60\n. This means that each coin would be worth $200,000 a coin. At a current price per coin of less than $100, this translates into an investment return (started today) of over 2,000x\n \xe2\x80\x93\n or more than 5x greater than even our Bitcoin scenario. If we now probability weight it (at 1%) we have a future expected value per coin of $2,000, and an expected return (that is, probability weighted and present valued) of 35%. Again, this does not represent our return in a success scenario (that would be the 2,000x+ appreciation), merely the implied discount rate which by virtue of the fact that it is higher than the risk-free-rate indicates current p\nrices are undervalued. To find today\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98fair value\xe2\x80\x99 we apply the same formula as we did with\nBitcoin\n \xe2\x80\x93\n \ndiscounting our future \xe2\x80\x98expected value\xe2\x80\x99 of $2,000 at the\n10-year risk-free-rate, or 2.5%. This yields = 20,000/(1.025^10) or $1,562\n \xe2\x80\x93\n nearly 16 times current levels.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s more.\n This analysis ignores the prospect that in a\n\xe2\x80\x98\nBitcoin success\n\xe2\x80\x99\n scenario (one in which it has not been banned, outlawed or otherwise stifled) there will\nstill \n be demand for strictly private\nmoney transactions. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s du\ne to black market transactions, or simply people not wanting their activities to be part of the public record, demand for Monero will persist at some level. '"

Now before you start telling me I\'m crazy for aiming so high, let me explain...\n\nI started a company on my last leg. Everyone said I was crazy and that there was no way my business model would work. I had $400 dollars to my name; barely scraping by, week to week. I took that $400 and did $400k in total revenue in my first four months. I did it by, one offering a superior product, and two (most importantly in this example) I started at the top. \n\nI didn\'t call secretaries hoping to get passed around the office until I spent enough time bugging people that I got in front of a decision maker. I called and asked for the owner by name. I would show up and act like I owned the place because I was doing the owner a favor by offering him something he couldn\'t find elsewhere. Quality work. ""I\'ll never be the cheapest, but I will always be the best.""\n\nIf BC can get a foot in the door, partner with someone and lower their market cap for a while (Who wants to spend 7,000 anything on a gallon of milk?)

I'm personally not very hopeful about the future of web-mining, but I hope i'm wrong!"""
12,b'Thoughts & Concerns Around Web-Mining',2,"b""> Too many threads with multiple tabs: let's say you visit multiple web-pages each implementing a web-miner. Which is allowed to run, or do they all run? Hash rate goes down drastically if there are too many competing compute threads while CPU usage will be through the roof. This makes for a bad user experience.\n\nBy default the miner will only start if no other miners are working. There is an option to kill other miners or to start without killing other miners. The last option is used in captchas.\n\n> Battery consumption. A previous post was kind enough to provide a code snippet for how to enable compute only above a certain battery level. With no guarantee that web-devs will implement this, how will bad user experiences be prevented? I think the easiest solution there is that the software provider (i.e. Coinhive) mandates behavior. \n\nI was the one who first published a code to detect the visitors battery, but it works only on chrome and opera. You shouldn't rely on this to block the miner, you can only try use this to improve the user experience.\n\n> Profitability. For many websites, where users are <90 seconds, and frequently visited by low-power mobile devices, I can't make the math work out in favor of mining. That said, most stats I've found are around page-views, not page-duration - so it's a little hard to compare.\n\nGoogle Analytics tells you the avg visit duration. I'm earning more with the miner than with ads. If you know a little of javascript you can make the navigation with pure javascript in a transparent way to the visitors, similar to what sites like facebook and youtube do. By preventing the page from reloading you prevent the miner from start and stop multiple times.\n\n> Motivation to turn off ads in favor of web-mining. A company is motivated to maximize profits - therefore I think more than likely they'd try to show ads in addition running a miner. This again leads to a worse user experience.\n\nThat's not how you maximize profits. You need to maintain a good user experience to make a profit in the long term. Those who only cares about short term gains doesn't care about the user experience, those are the ones who are already advertising malwares in exchange for a buck."""
12,b'Thoughts & Concerns Around Web-Mining',1,"b""My concerns are largely around the effect on Monero's price. \n\nAll of a sudden you have a fairly large group of users generating cryptocurrency who aren't as interested in the future of XMR -- rather, the appeal of making a much greater return than through traditional web ads.\n\nThese users aren't going to HODL or invest further; they're going to cash out ASAP. This will drive the price down, and is one of the reasons that I personally believe that Monero's price has been falling relative to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMaybe I'll be proven wrong, who knows."""

They'll only know about the transactions they make, there's no way one can see the transactions of the other, unless of course they work together.\n\nThe problem of using the same address always is when you want to keep an anonymous relationship with some entity.

21,b'Process for Automatically Selecting Remote Nodes in GUI \xc2\xb7 Issue #602',1,"b'Github issue 602 seems like an interesting proposal. It will let the daemon and wallet discover and use remote nodes in a decentralized and automated fashion. It combines a certain level of convenience with a certain level of security.  \n  \nThe accompanying dev meeting brings up a lot of interesting ideas on how to implement it and the problems of the proposal.  \n  \nDuring the dev meeting it was decided that issue 605 should not be implemented. This is a related proposal that proposes a drop-down menu of nodes from various sources.  \nLightweight solutions like mymonero seem to get favored by some over proposal 602, but proposal 602 was not explicitly rejected. Have there been any new insights that shed some new light on this idea? Is there is room for a decentralized and automated discovery process of untrusted remote nodes like issue 602 proposes?  \n  \nIt seems like a valuable option to have, specially for people who are waiting for the initial full sync of the blockchain. Right now the blockchain is still relatively small but once it crosses the 100+ gigabyte it will take some time for the daemon to catch up. Especially for people on a low bandwidth connection or those that download the blockchain via Kovri or Tor.  \n  \nDue to security concerns it might not be acceptable to integrate it into the official wallet. But what about a plugin that adds this feature to the official wallet?  \n  \nAre there people who would like to use something like github issue 602? Maybe only to do a quick check of the balance of a couple of wallets while the blockchain is syncing in the background.  \n  \nOn a related note: Are there people who are interested in a Tor .onion or .I2P equivalent of moneroworld.com that will only provide Tor .onion or .I2P remote nodes. Setup moneroworld.i2p for example and create a simple script that will output one or more remote nodes. Users will be able to use the script in combination with the CLI wallet to automatically select a node. GUI users can use it to manually configure a remote node in the GUI. This idea will make the discovery and use of remote nodes easier and more private and anonymous.  \n  \nIt is not a perfect solution, ideally it would all be decentralized and everybody would use their own node all the time. But this idea only tries to improve the existing situation a little bit. Some people might benefit from this.  \n  \nAre there people who are interested in using a Tor or I2P equivalent of moneroworld.com?  \n  \nIs someone interested in hosting such a service? /u/gingeropolous? Setup a Tor .onion and/or I2P address for moneroworld.com and create a simple list with .onion and .i2p nodes?  \n  \nWe are also thinking about ways to provide financial compensation to remote node operators. Maybe users can do some mining while using the remote node or make a donation. Perhaps this can be integrated in the script as well. We are open to suggestions on this.  \n  \nAre there people who would use background mining to support remote nodes if this was simple to use?'"

This is a coin that will gradually build until it becomes a major player. It has a market cap that is almost reached. It's a high cap so it has a lot of usability. Unlike other coins that want to jump to $250 dollars off the bat and look good. BCN has potential for real life application. Not spending .0000000234 BCN for a gallon of milk. \n\nI believe once the Market cap is reached, scarcity will drive up the price slightly. but like I said, this is a long term coin, not a get rich quick coin.\n"""

However in parallel you can also setup a local wallet and transfer your funds to it, so they will not know to whom the XMR was transfered.\n\nSecurity - I\'ve never heard about any security issues with KRAKEN, but it highly depends on how you manage your account. Make sure to use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and strong password it\'s an absolute must for a basic security in online environment.\n\nBut beware, KRAKEN has a TERRIBLE! support (at least it did from May 2017- Aug 2017 when I tested).

27,b'Newbie to Monero. How do I ensure truly untraceable privacy?',6,"b'The coins that are sent to your ransom address will ensure there is no linkability between you and the sender *on the blockchain* by using one component: stealth addresses. However, the caveat with only having stealth addresses is that the sender of your ransom coins is still able to see or trace the coins they\'ve given you, if you ever decide to move them. This issue of traceability is solved by another component: ring signatures. Ring signatures mask the outputs, so if you move the coins out of your ransom address, the sender won\'t be able to tell if it\'s their coins that have been moved. This is essentially done by grouping your transaction with other transactions in the blockchain to achieve obfuscation, and ultimately, you have *plausible deniability* (i.e. there is no evidence that that was their coins, or that was you within the mixin). Furthermore, the *amount* (number of coins) being transacted is concealed by a third component: confidential transactions. Confidential transactions is a cryptographic tool that lets the network verify the amount that is being transacted, without revealing any actual details. ""Confidential Transactions include a cryptographic proof that the sum of the input amounts is the same as the sum of the output amounts, without revealing the actual numbers.""\n\nThere are further ways to ensure greater safety, such as using a higher mixin, to group your transaction with more than just four other transactions, to achieve greater obfuscation and to make it ""even harder to trace"" the coins being moved. The caveat with using a higher mixin is that it makes your transaction standout in the [blockchain](https://xmrchain.net/). Have a look at the ""ring size"" column on the blockchain, and you will notice that most transactions use the default mixin of four (totalling to a ring size of ""five""), but there are some other transactions utilizing higher mixins, like a ring size of six, or eleven (as of writing).\n\nAnother component is shielding your IP address, which Kovri is going to solve.'"

If you were being monitored, someone could potentially tell you use monero but not how much you have and who or where you sent it. Your plan breaks down when you send it to the exchanges. Once you go to BTC everything is traceable. They will track that all the way back to the exchange and see you deposited 100 xmr there. And that's the best case scenario for you.

In his newest release, he is changing the license to a dual license (free for open-source, paid for commercial). Two questions arose from the discussion:\n\n1. Should Monero be relicensed to a dual license (at this point, consensus is largely 'no', but feel free to weigh in)?\n\n2. Should Monero have dependencies that are non-permissive anywhere (differing opinions, but take note of the difference between consensus vs non-consensus code)?\n\nSo yeah. Pop by and give your thoughts. The more eyes on this the better. Monero is not an oligarchy, monarchy, or dictatorship. It's a grassroots, community-drive project. And that means YOU can influence the future of Monero.\n\nEDIT: Please note, this discussion is not trying to make a copyleft vs. permissive license debate (google it if you don't know the difference). The reality is, both exist. The question is which one is best for Monero (including dependencies)."""
51,"b""Let's get eyes on the licensing discussion!""",13,b'My vote would be for the Monero project to continue adhering to the same permissive license restrictions. That would mean sticking with LMDB 0.9 for now and possibly moving to a new DB in the future as needed.

51,"b""Let's get eyes on the licensing discussion!""",8,"b'There is really no functional impact in the Monero project. As I understand it if a company uses and sells modified Monero (consensus) code that messes with lmdb then they will need to give back to the lmdb project by adding their changes under the same license (i.e. make it open source).  The real issue is a philosophical question about whether or not the Monero code base should contain any restrictive licensing. There is also a big difference between managing the license with consensus code and extremities such as the GUI or or other random projects that community members create. \n\nTLDR. Should the core of Monero contain a dependency with a restrictive license or in the spirit of true open source should it be completely restrictionless.\n\nPlease correct me if i am missing something.\n\nI personally think its a tough call but would lean towards a restrictionless model for the core components\n\nEdit: Id say the biggest ""physical"" issue is a future where Monero is riddled with dependencies that all have slight restrictions on them that makes commercialization impossible.

The long and short is that Monero\'s coin issssuance is nothing like Bitcoin\'s. Monero issuance will issue the vast majority of coins in a small timeframe of 5-ish years, whereas Bitcoin is designed to take 15-20 years. Monero\'s issuance schedule whittles down to a tiny block reward approximately less than ~1% inflation per year) once 18 million coins are mined in 2022. Each block reward will then be fixed at 0.6 XMR per block, forever.\n\nThis fixed inflation however means that as the pool of coins increases, the effects of inflation on the overall existing supply will have less and less impact on the value of existing coins. It\'s commonly referred to as disinflationary, each year, the inflation rate will proportionately decrease year-on-year. If this doesn\'t put your mind at ease, then consider that it\'ll take approximately 120 years for Monero\'s coin total to double Bitcoin\'s fixed 21 million coins, which occurs in another 123 or something years.\n\n> If so, how could XMR ever be considered a sound investment?\n\nIf you forsee your lifetime spanning hundreds of years (are you planning to reach the grand old age of 500years old?), then yes, might be a shaky investment, and might be best to stay away! But considering that\'s it\'s very likely that you will die before any of this inflation has any chance of affecting you (or more likely EVER affecting you) , then I think you\'ll agree that the ""infinite inflation problem"" is not something any of us, nor your children\'s children\'s children\'s children will have to worry about.'"

This sends a clear message to the world: Monero is untraceable. The publicity, level of exposure, and proof of untraceability to the masses will increase demand for Monero, and I believe it will actually drive the price upwards after an initial downturn.\n\nAfter the first wave of bans, I believe there will be a sort of ""Monero golden age"" where awareness and adoption is high, but most governments haven\'t had time to react and regulate. Eventually, more governments could ban Monero. But adoption may be so extensive by this point that it doesn\'t matter.\n\nI do think that the fears of widespread bans aimed at Monero are overstated. Governments aren\'t stupid, they realize that banning one privacy cryptocurrency just guarantees that another will take its place. This accomplishes nothing. Like I mentioned earlier, some governments might still ban Monero (and this is probably good for Monero). But I believe most governments will take a more sensible approach : regulate cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptodebit cards. We\'ve already seen the beginning of this regulation in China and Korea. This approach allows the government to collect its taxes on all cryptocurrencies and also allows people to keep a basic right to privacy.'"

With the release of CoinHive, we saw and came to believe browser mining can change the web in a HUGE and POSITIVE way. Sadly, the direction browser mining is currently headed is *bleak*. The average web user (now) knows little to nothing about cryptocurrency or mining. All they hear are news stories of Monero in connection with drugs on the ""dark net"" and now a ""virus"" that is STEALING your computer power (without you knowing)! This website is our attempt at steering perception away from the bad browser mining does to the good it could do. Some facts about our site: FEE - Right now we are using CoinHive since we began our site when it was the only release. We are hopeful an open source alternative will come out soon to remove their overly large percentage. CoinHive takes their 30% and we take 5%. Again, we hope to switch to a (future) version soon so we can make it just 5. FEATURES: Anyone can make a ""tab"" that they can share with their friends (ex. Tabfor.org/SaveTheDolphins). Embedded IRC chat so you can talk to other people that are tabbing for the same cause. Layman friendly FAQ. PAYOUTS: CoinHive pays out when you earn .5 XMR, so that is when you will get it. Please leave any questions you have or suggestions for the page/direction this could go. Thanks for reading!     '"

People who invested a lot in it (think millions) and who want a quick ROI for the short term will cash out and this will cause the price to go down, below $0.01, maybe around $0.005. You should not worry at this point as it won't be enough time for game developers to start its integration. Next year will highly depend on the team. Given their networks and their records, 2018 looks very positive and I think it will be going towards mass adoption very quickly. I messaged them about the Block Reward for mining and they are still not sure and they told me they will need to see the mass stats first. During early November to mid 2018, I think  a good chunk of the ETNs will be mined and there will be enough in circulation. Right now more than 200K people have signed up, and all of them will be having the app. This is already viral as we speak, and next year with so many people with an app and free money on it, they will look at spending it. This will create a demand for games and businesses to adopt ETN as a payment method, increasing the price of an ETN. If all goes well, $1 by December 2018 is not out of reach. This could easily give ETN a market cap of 9-10 Billion max, depending on how much will be mined. If it's all positive, and the prices of coins keep going up, we might even see a $2-3 by end of next year,  but that's really really optimisitic and will only happen if we get lucky. I'm in the process of building an ETN exchange that I will try to launch by mid-November. This thing is gonna make history. :-) If you're looking at investing a small amount, invest and keep it. You will be a happy person a few years down the line. """

3,b'Response to Nexus Earth Criticisms from A Casual Nexus Subscriber',24,"b'This is Colin here, and it seems many people have colorful opinions of me.\n\nI will address all these points simply now:\n\n1. Nexus was based on Peercoin as a base, which was closer to Satoshi\'s original code of 0.6.3, I have since coded most of the Bitcoin code out, but wished to start with this code base as a reference for learning how everything worked while finding ways to improve it.\n\n2. Unified Time is a ""time synchronization"" protocol to overcome some of the ""timestamping"" limitations of Bitcoin Core having an allowable drift of up to 2 hours in the future for blocks, making this a very inaccurate timestamping engine. The code for Unified Time in Nexus can be seen here: https://github.com/Nexusoft/Nexus/blob/master/src/core/unifiedtime.cpp#L176\n\n3. The consensus code for Bitcoin checking the MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME is found here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L2942 The constant MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME can be found here as 2 * 60 * 60 which equates to 2 hours allowable future block time drift:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chain.h#L21\n\n4. The multiple mining channels have their own difficulty adjustments, and together form a block time of around 1 minute as each channel uses 2-3 minute difficulty targets to keep the chain on track. This can be confirmed in the code here: https://github.com/Nexusoft/Nexus/blob/master/src/core/difficulty.cpp#L16\n\n5. There is code in the ""trust"" of each block that states that blocks made with previous blocks of the same channel get less trust, so that another channel can prevent a 51% attack on one channel. This is due to the fact that in order to rewrite the chain one would need to make 3x as many blocks on one channel to overcome one block of previous different channel. This can be seen in the code here: https://github.com/Nexusoft/Nexus/blob/master/src/core/core.h#L1699\n\n6. The reserve calculations are done by an interval of 1 minute overlapping the floor of a block timespan, to calculate based on exponential decay equation: e^-kt, carefully choosing a constant, and having the block reward value based upon the amount contained in the reserve. You can see this here: https://github.com/Nexusoft/Nexus/blob/master/src/core/release.cpp#L18\n\nI might add that to understand this, it would be better not to assume one knows without reviewing the code.\n\nIt would also be more productive to scrutinize a system, and rather not resort to personal attacks of opinion that don\'t go further than reverting to ""ad hominem"" which only causes a degradation of character.\n\nFluffy describing Bitcoin as a ""timestamping engine"" is only quoting Satoshi Nakamoto\'s white paper, section 2, called ""timestamp server"", but neglects to analyze the following 10 sections of technical information. The idea of having a timestamp, but allowing a drift of 2 hours in the future, while calling technology designed to enhance the accuracy and security of this misunderstood would not be the proper technical argument.\n\nYou are free to analyze the Bitcoin White Paper again:\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf'"

One thing to consider is that most of the capital raised during the ICO were during the 10-20% bonus periods, not before. \n\nThis is a rare crypto with a real specific target and marketing goal: widespread mobile use and applications. Even Tezos, which was originally ""the blockchain of the future"", now has its devs trying to figure out what to do with it. By contrast, we know exactly what Electroneum\'s devs are going to do with it. They\'re going to market its usage. It\'s not about sitting on a coin (though I plan to sit on it for a long time.) It\'s about its public use.\n\nIf you are looking for a .02-.05 pump and dump you\'ll get your chance sooner than later. But I think most of us are going to sit it out because of what Electroneum represents for the future. No point in regretting your purchase. Smarter to wait it out.'"
3,"b""Please convince me that I didn't made a mistake investing in this""",2,"b""I got involved in this ico in a small way but I do have concerns. \n\nRichard is clearly good at what he does and no he has the money to back it up but the team have a kind of cheap look about them and there is a management gap. Sales and marketing types are never technical and they need support on the technical management side of things. The block chain guy is basically a junior programmer. You really need an experienced block chain developer on board. They have a gaming 'advisor' and have spoken about engaging with the industry at some point. Well this should have started already and they need a full time gaming guy with good connections at a high level in the industry. The gaming industry will be a hard sell. I know it pretty well. The money is there so hopefully this is being taken care of but it's all very late.\n\nThen there is mobile 'mining' which is not really mining at all. A lot of BS has been thrown around concerning mobile mining but it's clearly a gimmick aimed at getting newcomers on board and that could really benefit everyone (not just those involved in this coin) and as such it could work well.\n\nFrom where I stand the simple fact is that (mobile) mining cannot be profitable or attractive at all or the numbers potentially wont add up. It's value lies in getting newcomers involved and not attracting those with a 6 x 1070 ether rig sitting under their tv or a guy willing to set up a phone farm. Talk about some guy in Africa earning $20 every week is just not sustainable. Even with the high coin supply it can't work. If you was earning say .01 of an Electroneum a day on the top mobile spec that may work. Newcomers will be less concerned with the value while it is a gimmick but the coin needs to have some use other than just selling (back to the gaming point). There will be a hack to fool the app into thinking you have a top spec phone and a lot of people will be running it. That is a fact (though maybe less so on iOS) which raises more problems. I'm sure they will adjust mobile rewards as required so this could work if done right despite the dubious (but understandable from a marketing point of view) 'mining' references.\n\nInitial price. This is interesting. I'm sure the price will surge as the pressure builds up now the sale has closed early. Who knows what the level could be. my guess is 5 cents to 20 (maybe even 30) cents with a dump to follow but I'm sure they have big marketing plans and this could result in people holding and maybe a price climb quickly to follow any dump. The rest depends on Richard really. I have no idea and this is what makes crypto\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\n\nSo I have my worries. There is a lot of work ahead and they need to hire new people and catch up on the gaming side. The flip side is they have all the cash they need to make this work if it's done right so no excuses."""

I would love for the devs to prove me wrong and for it to really take off but I'm planning to sell mine if it goes over 25 cents a coin.\n\nTheir whitepaper was pretty atrocious.  More grammatical and spelling errors than I could count.

4,"b'Don\'t you find the ""2 decimal digits"" limit ridiculous?'",1,"b""It'll never get that high based purely on market cap. Right now the market cap is $40 million, based on $0.01 tokens. If the price moves up with $0.1, the market cap is $400 Million, and then 1 dollar would be $4 Billion. Lets assume ETN can take a quarter of Bitcoins market cap, which currently sits at $100 Billion with 16 million coins. So we make it to 25 Billion dollars, and that's being extremely optimistic. Well currently $40 Million adds up to roughly 4 Billion Electroneum coins. So lets assume that gets tripled in the next two years or so due to graciously giving out the extra 2 billion that was supposed to be part of the token sale which will be a bonus to cellular miners, and then the real mining. That assumes each coin will be be valued 50% less. So with that math out of the way, if ETN reached $25 Billion Dollars in market cap on 8 Billion coins, that leaves the value at around a maximum of $3 USD which could of course grow but the coin cap is set to 21 Billion.

16,b'How does blockchain competition get resolved?',2,"b""This is an interesting question. I had not thought of this route to consolidation. First, I don't think it's possible technologically to merge blockchains. Second, I don't think it's possible to merge projects from a governance standpoint. It's not as if each cryptocurrency has a CEO and Board of Directors that can approve a merger or sale. \n\nThe most that can happen - and we've seen this already a few times - is that developers from one project can abandon the project to work on another one. Monero actually started this way, as developers from Bytecoin left to create their own fork of the technology. \n\nThe closest thing to a merger of two *viable* projects that might be possible is that one crypto's community decides to abandon their project to work on another project instead. Then - somehow - the holders of that currency are allowed to redeem their units for units of the new currency. \n\nSo let's say Litecoin adopts Monero's privacy tech. The whole Monero community (developers, miners, etc) migrate to Litecoin. Then somehow holders of Monero are allowed to swap their Monero for Litecoin at a fixed exchange rate. \n\nI don't know how that would be done from a logistical or governance standpoint, but it is an interesting question. Maybe a merger of Zcash and Monero or Litecoin and Monero would help them compete against Dash and Bitcoin? \n\nWe've already reinvented IPOs as ICOs. I'm sure at some point someone will figure out how to do M&A. \n\n"""

At some point most of the private liquid capital in the world will start flowing into one private / fungible blockchain.

When he died he left information on how to get into his accounts and thats been it for me ever since.\n\nMy thoughts and goals with crypto... Well I am pretty forward-thinking.  I just keep thinking to myself that 1,000 years from now when we are trading between planets that we won't be using USD to do it.  I think that we will be using some type of cryptocurrency at that time (though since we will have been using it for 1,000 years I doubt that we will call it crypto - it'll simply be money lol).  So basically a revolution is coming and its starting now.\n\nThe idea of secrecy/freedom/anonymity is cool but practically speaking if the entire world was using secret money it would be very hard to collect tax revenues - this is great for an individual but cataclysmic for civilizations (which, in turn makes it pretty fucking bad for that individual lol).  I actually don't think that crypto will *really* be able to step in and take over until it is traceable in one form or another.  It sucks but with our current culture, economies and infrastructure governments do *have* to be aware of who has what money and what they are doing with it - maybe in a few hundred years someone will come up with a system no one has thought about yet - but as of now for economic stability and security reasons the world simply can not switch to anonymous secret money. \n\nI like most of the ethos behind crypto.  I like freedom from banks (though there is nothing stopping banks from buying up all the crypto and controlling that *shrug*).  I like the concept of digital money/assets and as I have said before eventually we will be switching to it completely.\n\nAs of right now I am not hoping to see money transferred between Mars and Earth in crypto (for obvious reasons).  I am not on a crusade to undermine the banking system.  I am not trying to overthrow governments and create anarchy through depriving them of tax revenue.  I am mostly just hoping that my crypto assets will continue to rise and provide me some economic freedom.  I don't need 10 million dollars or anything so I don't have to work again - I just want a nice blanket that I can dip into for vacations, purchasing homes, vehicles, yuno?  Sure I think about what would happen if Iota (my main investment) hits 100 dollars a coin - but I'm not counting on it.  I am hoping that I can end up with a couple hundred thousand bucks (which is actually reasonable considering what I have invested if my coin of choice does half of what its supposed to).\n\nSo there you have it - a rambling, eclectic message from me on what I'm hoping to get out of crypto and my general thoughts about it.\n\nPeace and love."""

6,b'this is why ETN could reach 5$ easly',3,"b""The article is okay but the OP is missing a few key points. You see, as the supply of ETN increases, it will need a demand to meet that supply and if the demand is low, the price will be lower so that more people will have an incentive to buy it, and therefore bring market closer and closer to equilibrium point. Alternatively, if we have a very high demand, and the supply is low, the price per ETN will be way more, again for that equilibrium to be attained. As of now, Electroneum has no use and it's only when it starts being used that it's demand will start to rise. I think that if the team is smart with the amount of ETN per block released, this thing can grow big if they manage to implement at least half of what is described in their whitepaper. The market cap is not a good measure as TheQuantumPhysicist said. Cryptoccurency at this stage is too volatile. I guess if Electroneum could achieve a general currency with ETN that is not only used in games but is adopted in many places, this could help in bring more stability into its value in the long run.

If you try to liquidate all the Bitcoin we have, it\'ll probably not make 10M$. The reason is simple: Slippage.

But in a volatile market where the price could drop by over 40% over one night, I don\'t understand the usefulness of such a quantity. Imagine you tell your friend that the MC of Bitcoin is 100B$, and then you wake up next day and you find it 70B$. With such an example, I would really start questioning the purpose of such a value in a super-volatile market.\n\nOf course, this is all the perspective of a physicist, who always looks for the most meaningful quantity to understand the world. I don\'t know if anything I said makes sense, but... every day is a new lesson :-)'"
6,b'this is why ETN could reach 5$ easly',1,"b""One thing that someone pointed out to me is this. The coin being issued isn't stock it is currency. The value isn't dependant on the companies success. The company may become successful for some other reason but the currency doesn't get adopted. They don't owe anything to the coin holders. If the company goes bankrupt and liquidates all its holdings it isn't required to turn around pay back coin holders.\n\nThe currency can become worth $1000 a coin but the company is only worth $1 billion because the market cap of the company is not tied to the value of the coin.

You say in the article that:\n\n*    It has a critical community...Every Sunday, Monero users discuss the top criticisms of the coin in /r/Monero.     *\n\nThis is a frankly laughable assertion. I\'ve not seen any project outside of religion be more insular and more enforcing of groupthink. Hell, the ""Skepticism Sunday"" thread you are referring to has appeared a grand total of two times. And it was created *specifically because* the Monero community is such an echo chamber.\n\nThink about that. The Monero project is so full of fanbois that a regular thread needed to be created every week, just to counter it. \n\nI also disagree with your next point that, ""*[Monero] was launched fairly. There was no premine, instantmine, or ICO.*""\n\nLooking at the emission curve, that may not be a ""pre-mine"" but it certainly was premined.  The massive majority of Monero was made in the very early stages. So while that isn\'t technically pre-mined, early adopters got the lion\'s share.

Therefore, I\'d advise to just start the GUI, make sure the blockchain location is correct, and subsequently start the daemon from within the GUI.\n\nIn addition, in Monero there\'s two ""syncs"". First, the blockchain sync, which is basically downloading the blockchain from other nodes / peers. Second, the wallet sync, which is the wallet ""refreshing"" / scanning blocks looking for transactions belonging to your address / wallet. It could be that your daemon is already fully synced, but you still have to refresh the wallet. Thus, the status indicator on the left bottom (of the GUI) is likely showing the number of blocks it still needs to refresh.\n\nTo check your daemon status, go to the `Settings` page and press `Show status`. The block height should equal the block height displayed on a blockchain explorer like, for instance, [XMRchain](https://xmrchain.net). \n\n>s the blockchain location supposed to include the folder imdb?\n\nShouldn\'t be, but try it out (i.e. check both with and without an lmdb folder) and check whether it makes a difference.

4,b'Big holder frustrated with these wallet updates',9,"b'Note that, in Monero, there\'s two ""syncs"". First, the blockchain sync, which is basically downloading the blockchain from other nodes / peers. Second, the wallet sync, which is the wallet ""refreshing"" / scanning blocks looking for transactions belonging to your address / wallet. Currently the two syncs are both displayed by the same status bar, which may be confusing from time to time. In addition, like u/gingeropolous said, if you haven\'t used the wallet for a few days, it needs to catch up the last few days worth of blocks, which takes some time. Thus, every time you open the wallet, just let it run for some time and eventually it should be fully synced (both the wallet and daemon). '"

9,b'Is Monero secure on my OS?',4,"b'Being completely honest, there\'s no way to know if your OS is tracking your transactions if you use a proprietary OS, because you can\'t audit the code, so you just can\'t know.\n\nThat being said, my ""common sense"" tells me that neither Windows nor OS X will track your Monero transactions. At least not in the time being. Maybe in a future where Monero and cryptocurrency have an enormous impact in politics and economy.\n\nNow, for the secure part: of course there are OSs that are more secure than others, but usually even Windows 10 can be ok and well guarded. There are good practices to follow to make sure your OS is safe, and with Windows 10 you should take even more steps.\n\nThis doesn\'t mean Windows 10 is insecure by default. This doesn\'t mean that if you do a fresh install of Windows 10 you get by default 7 trojans, 3 virus, 2 keyloggers and 7 hackers who have access to your computer. People might sound like that, but it\'s not true. If you don\'t visit kinky, bizarre porn websites, if you do your due diligence about security on the web, if you have uBlocker, HTTPS everywhere, Privacy Badger, block third-party cookies, etc, if you have a good antivirus that is always updated, etc... then you\'re probably ok. Seriously, you probably are.\n\nBut remember, if you\'re using Windows 10, there are better alternatives available if you\'re thinking security-wise. But you are not obligated to switch OSs.

Yawwwnnn...\n\nAnd to those who say that it is B.S. that they raised $40million. Well they did.

But if you really read the technical white paper (not just the white paper), they specifically says in actuality no mining will be done on the mobile phones. And anyone who knows technology already knew that. Their mobile phones would blow up to smithereens. \n\nIf we can introduce apps and business models into the cryptocurrency space that FINALLY travels in the direction of MASS ADOPTION, then I am all for it.  Right now, it is sorely missing and is more of a nerdy tech fest. Yes... I'm one of those nerds - proudly so.\n\nIf a new business comes onto the forefront, they can either fail or succeed.  Look at all of the restaurants that fail every day just in New York alone. But at least they tried even with a trail of naysayers beating down their necks.\n\nI never understood why folks ALWAYS try to find the BAD in EVERYTHING rather than take the other route and say here are the GOOD points.

Talk to someone about privacy and their eyes gloss over. \n\nWe should be using language that targets specific problems and when someone hears that their problem can be solved they\'ll catch on real quick. Skip all the fear and paranoia bs. \n\nOnce Monero becomes super easy to use and incorporates some form of layer-2 scaling it\'s game over. Monero will capture a thin slice of a multi-trillion dollar market for drugs, gambling, money laundering, and wealth obfuscation to say nothing of all the legal use cases for businesses and individuals who need to protect themselves for any number of reasons. \n\nAnd then it\'ll become so boring and well known that it won\'t even be called Monero anymore, just whatever slang word for it is used in a particular language. Teenage girls will use it in messaging apps like kik to send money to their crushes or their friends to pay for pizza and they\'ll love it because their parents can\'t spy on them. (Teens can\'t get a bank account remember, and have to rely on their parents who are becoming increasingly paranoid and spy on their kids like it\'s the Cold War).\n\nYou\'re right, people don\'t care about privacy. They want a technology that solves their problems.

You can\'t be 100% sure, but it\'s as legit as a centralized service gets. \n\n2) Nope, and there probably never will be. You can however connect to a remote node. You still have to synchronize (but not download and validate), which will still take *some* time. And you take a slight hit to privacy, but not really that much. *edit:* didn\'t realize you were asking about webwallets... Yeah, mymonero.com is an option. Doesn\'t really qualify to me as a ""real"" wallet though, and it\'s another centralized service. \n\n3) Bitcoin -> Monero -> Bitcoin is enough. You can save yourself the mixing after (in fact, you may get dirtier bitcoins out of a mixer than you put in). If you want to be extra sure, better go Bitcoin -> Monero -> Monero -> Bitcoin. The extra Monero step is called ""churning"", you can Google why that may help with privacy. '"

3,b'ELI5 offline wallets (1st timer)',3,"b""Yesterday I explained what paper wallets are. I'll paste it here:\n\n>The idea is very simple. First: Your wallet doesn't have any money, before or after a transaction. Your wallet is a key to access money on the blockchain.\nWhen you create a wallet, you create a new set of keys that are empty (zero balance). Now you transfer money to that address (the one associated with the key you created), and the blockchain registers that your address has that balance. Now, you have money registered for your keys. In order to move this money from there to another account, you use your private key to sign a transaction, and that's how the blockchain approves of the transaction. The important thing to understand here, is that the perpetuator would need the private key that corresponds to the address, to which you sent the money in the first place. So again, there's no money in the wallet, but there's keys to access money on the blockchain.\n>The account that you log into in the electroneum website has nothing to do with the wallet you create. The wallet is just a blind tool to create keys (blind in the sense that it doesn't distinguish between accounts). It's just a simple webapp that creates keys for anyone. The same one that I used actually to create my own keys, and everyone else. In fact, you can download it as an HTML file (that's offered in that page). The only reason our keys are different is because of the randomness used to generate the keys.\n>When you transfer money to your wallet (i.e., to the associated address/key), the electronic wallet (desktop/mobile) will protect you as much as possible, and will be your practical tool for sending and receiving money. The paper wallet, though, will remain the last line of defense. If your house burns down and you lose your computer, you can use the paper wallet to access your funds again. Now how that's done in detail, I don't know. We don't have the software yet, but once the desktop wallet is available, this question will be answerable, because this depends on the implementation.\n"""

I don't know how your cluster is used, so I couldn't answer whether this is likely or not.\n\nI think that what I would do is set up a batch script with walltime 4 hours or less and have it only run at night after 02:00AM.

Nobody can see how much money you have or your transaction history (unless you give them a view key which is completely up to you).\n\nWhen you send a Monero transaction, your IP address is visible only to the first node it connects to. IP addresses are not stored on the blockchain, as hyc_symas pointed out. So, the exposure of one's IP address is small, but it's still a risk that is easily fixed by using TOR, I2P, VPN, or simply using the wifi at Starbucks (because Starbuck's IP is not your IP).\n\nMonero will be implementing Kovri I2P soon, which will route transactions over I2P by default.\n\nIf someone tells you that an IP address is the holy grail of privacy, they're focusing on a small piece of the privacy equation. What good would it do to make a transaction over TOR if the details of the transaction are all public, such as with BTC, Verge, or pretty much every other coin? Anyone can still see the transaction amount and the address to which it was sent, plus transaction histories and the account balances of any address.\n\nSo, while an IP address is a piece of the privacy equation, it's a smaller piece.

If this is your first time mining, this is probably not the best coin for newbies.  Keep in mind that most coins do not host their own pools, they are hosted by 3rd parties.\n\nThat said, think of this like mining gold.  There is a giant plot of land, and different companies are mining on it (the old fashioned way, with pick axes).  The more workers the company has, the better chance of finding a piece of gold.  Think of swinging that pickaxe as submitting a share.  You could swing that thing 100000000 times and not find a single nugget.  You could also swing it twice and find a piece.  That is how this works.  Your shares submitted only matter when they find a block.'"

Don't they teach decimals in like 3rd grade? \n\nAlso it doesn't matter if crypto wallets are in 92 languages. Bitcoin and ETH are in the top like 30-50 and that covers something like 99% of all the people on earth. So no real value there. And it's super easy to use a bitcoin/eth wallet, even on your phone. There are multiple apps available. Including blockchain.info which you don't even have to use decimals. If you want to send someone like $18.75 you just use USD value and the software converts it to btc/eth for you. You don't even have to think about the decimals. \n\nPeople here are looking for value where there isn't any. 300k people bought into the ICO, meanwhile coinbase alone is getting like 100k new accounts a day. There's no value here, it's going below 1 cent very fast. It's currently under 5 cents and only only very small volume. Anyone that holds this coin for a year or two will just watch their investment go no where. While bitcoin and the rest of the top 5 coins sky rocket in value. \n\nJust since I first read the white paper here and looked into this ICO back when they offered a 50% bonus and I passed on it, my bitcoin has went up in value from sub 5k up to over 7k. I've shorted eth and rode the recent bch surge for insane profits. \n\nStop the fallacy of believing that you need to find the lottery ticket altcoin/ICO to profit in the crypto space. You can make insane profits just playing around with the top 5. And I only hold bitcoin long term. It's crypto's daddy and nothing else is worth your time. \n\nGimmicks/buzzwords and twisting the facts won't make a coin successful, solving real problems and offering the things the market wants will do that. None of that exist here. It's a shit coin and will always be a shit coin. \n\nI'll buy the crash on this one once they unlock the ICO coins and ride the little pump up and I expect to make a nice 20-40% on my money in a few hours. After that I'll ignore this coin for a while then come back and find support/resistance and set alarms on it like do a bunch of shit coins. I'll also put bids way down in the books for those epic flash crashes. I'll make a killing here, but most of the 300k won't. This coin will never be $100. It will never see $1 with the current plan. You've been warned. I've been around reddit for years and i'm not going anywhere, so as long as they don't ban me, if i'm wrong I am happy to eat crow and admit. I doubt that ever happens though.

Browser mining should be held up to the same standards.\n\nWe also provide an easy and powerful builder that allows you to:\n\n - define cpu load, mining difficulty and mining duration according to desktop or mobile devices.\n - create a new wallet on generation or use your own\n - select a user notification of your choosing\n\nThere\'s also a Connect via Tor option which I think is a first for browser-based mining.\n\nSecurity: No login is required, since we do not store any details that might leave you vulnerable to attack.

There will inevitably be some minor downtime due to upgrading for the above features. We are not a clone of Coinhive and your support will give me the incentive to move faster!

You could do a statistical analysis of the blockchain to determine the current randomness of a specific chunk of each block, find a random number that appears random, but I don\'t think you can be sure you are getting a true random number in the future.  Since blocks are built deterministically(in a broad sense), it will be difficult/impossible to prove that your ""random number"" isn\'t susceptible to attack, although I do believe you could get a reasonably random number from the blockchain safely with a lot of work.\n\nRandom number generation is hard.  My guess is that the blockchain does not have a very random distribution.  With some serious statistical work, you could control for biases in the data and come up with a good pseudo-random number.  But I seriously doubt you can get a true random number from the blockchain without additional entropy.  Either way, this seems like a big project if you want to convince people that a number extracted from the blockchain is truly random.\n\nThere are plenty of sources of true random numbers on the internet, they tend to use a combination of multiple sources of physical entropy and cryptographic methods to produce a true random distribution that is safe from attack.

But think about the factors that influence the gold price:\n\n1. Investors buying gold to hedge against volatility in other markets. When investors anticipate global economic trouble, they buy gold which drives up the gold price.\n2. The supply of physical gold. The cost of mining gold is relatively stable because technological progress is relatively slow and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many new deposits being found that are easy to mine. If technological progress accelerates rapidly (which it may well do with the AI revolution and cheap access to space) the price of mining gold could fall dramatically.\n\nIf XMR becomes the world\xe2\x80\x99s reserve currency then it may be used as a hegde against risk just like gold is today, but the difference being that its market cap would be much bigger so the volatility caused by hedging should be much smaller. The supply of XMR is predetermined. No new XMR deposit is going to be found on an asteroid near Earth. Better mining technology will only increase the difficulty, not the supply.\n\nThere may be other factors that will influence the XMR price, but I think we just have to wait and see what they will be. The current volatility is caused by the small market cap and low adoption and does not reflect what a future success scenario will look like.'"

37,b'Is Monero being adopted as a common currency really plausible?',1,"b'> It\'s just not practical to use something as money when its value relative to the goods you are out purchasing varies by plus or minus 5 to 10 percent on a daily basis.\n\nVolatility is temporary, as it was said, it only shows that the market is immature. I might be wrong, even more because this is the infancy of the cryptocurrency scene, but I believe these ""forks"" we\'re seeing are somewhat exceptions because the scene is immature. The moment we\'re tapping billions in market cap, you won\'t be able to ""fork a 10 billion cryptocurrency"" from one day to the other only because you want. As it is with pretty much all institutions, the older it gets, the mature it becomes. The more mature it gets, less changes will be made.\n\nEven animals behave like that to a certain point. When you\'re a kid/teenager your view of the world changes every 45 minutes. When you get older and become an adult, you view of the world stabilizes and you change less. Anyway, I\'m overextending, but my point is that I believe (I have absolutely zero proofs and zero ways of predicting the future) the volatility is temporary and the price will stabilize once the market becomes more mature (which means more money, which means more adoption, which means the whole world using it).\n\nNo need to attach it to gold or whatever. The stability will come naturally. More or less like the price of gold. Why is gold stable and why can\'t Monero reproduce the same behaviour? Let\'s think about that.'"

37,b'Is Monero being adopted as a common currency really plausible?',1,"b""Probably not for a long time.\n\nI think currently digital currencies best use case is in things like remittance, capital flight, store of wealth (though this requires some belief in the technology). \n\nOnce big institutional money gets involved and there is less room for volatility (all the BTC spiking is heavily dominated by dumb money, look how many people buy at ath's). I personally think taking a top down approach with regards to target markets of wealth is the best way to one day see any of these currencies treated as currencies. """
37,b'Is Monero being adopted as a common currency really plausible?',1,"b""If using cryptocurrencies was commonplace, it would have a stabilizing effect on prices.\n\n  People don't realize that the US dollar can fluctuate too, because prices don't change every day to reflect that. In a way, the USD is pegged to the cost of life, minus inflation. It could go down 10% against the Euro over a few weeks, but unless you're buying something European-made or travelling to Europe, you'll never notice.\n\n  Of course it doesn't fluctuate as much as cryptocurrencies, but I wouldn't expect cryptocurrencies to fluctuate that much if people were using them as money. Expectations of profits would be down, and there would be a lot less trading between cryptos as the market matures. I think something like Ethereum would be an exception, because its price will always reflect the underlying ICOs and their impact on gas usage and as such works a bit more like a stock market fund."""

Though there\'s obviously a great deal of care when it comes to merging by Fluffy and the devs, this doesn\'t mean they let things languish in testing. Theres an emphasis on adding features if someone has done the hard work to submit it in the first place, rather than endlessly testing, discussing, etc. . I remember not long ago discussing this with fluffy, and he expressed a great deal of frustration around endless desire for ""testing"" being an excuse to not add it, which in turn meant that the code was never tested in the first place as it was never given the seriousness it deserved. \n\nIn Bitcoin it was an endless catch 22, if you wanted to add a feature, you needed to get it tested, but since there was no guarantee it\'d get pulled, no-one bothered testing it, so it was never added. Rinse, repeat. Though pulls are a little less reckless these days, I have not heard that fluffy has changed the policy of merging as long as it looks good, and adopting the policy of getting it in sooner so that others are FORCED to test it, rather than playing this retarded game of testing hot potato. It\'s fairly likely that RingCT would *never* have gotten added if Fluffy had changed this policy. Don\'t forget that RingCT was actually added barely a year after the CT paper was first published, and considering the massive undertaking, it was still rolled out sooner as the next scheduled hard was literally brought forward 3-4 months to get it out there and FORCE people to test the fuck out of it because everyone knew that it\'d be activated in record time.\n\nI think it\'s fair to say that Monero is one of the more liberal dev groups when it comes to making changes to the codebase and they are far less conservative than other projects. Generally, if you code up a feature, and it passes the sniff test, theres a strong chance it\'ll get merged as opposed to demanding sometimes endless and ultimately in many cases, useless tests. This has been a great policy in general for advancing things and is balanced by the fact that the devs have an overarching goal, and that is privacy first. Testing is great and all, but there comes a point where you must merge it before people will test it rigorously, and merging is often the only way to make that happen.\n\n'"

Lots of people bought into this who don't know a thing about the space. \n\nPrior to the release ETN had commercials playing in England, in Subway stations / train stations etc. They are the most active ICO on their social media - twitter, facebook, telegram etc. The people involved (Ells for instance) has been involved in fortune 500 companies.\n\nThey have had many celeb endorsements. \n\nThey are aiming to market to the unbanked of the world - this is HUGE. \n\nThe majority of the people pissed because wallets are still locked are in two camps. 1. they are completely new to crypto and this is their first ever purchase. 2. they wanted a quick flip like every other ICO.

53,b'What about fees if XMR = $1000',25,"b""> Monero\xe2\x80\x99s fees are mostly related to the block size which is dynamic. If transaction level stays the same but price drastically rises Monero\xe2\x80\x99s fees will be very expensive till an update (fork?) arrives that allows lower fees.\n \nThat's not how it works. Mining is an economical activity and is governed by economical principles (mostly game theory). If the price drastically rises, the profitability of mining would rise as well. They would outcompete and undercut for blocks, resulting in an equilibrium that is not far off what it was before.\n \n> My personal worst case scenario is a blockstream like take over that refuses any updates to lower the transaction fees.\n \nA refusal to make updates should be everybody's worst nightmare. Projects die that way, but it looks anything but imminent for Monero. Innovation is progressing at a healthy level.\n \nAlso I think you are completely misrepresenting the situation around Bitcoin with your statement. There hasn't been a takeover there is no refusal to do updates. There have been failed attempts that refused to address the core issues (seriously, a hardfork for 8mb blocks but still no solution for a flexible blocksize? You kidding?). Or that went about it the wrong way and introduced new issues (looking at you 2x).\n \nI think the Bitcoin community is by-and-large convinced that something needs to happen in terms of scaling and transaction cost. The reasons for the sluggishness have more to do with the consensus model, the messias-like presence of Satoshi and people's expectation that they are entitled to future wealth by holding a slice of 21 million.\n \nThe irony being that Satoshi envisioned Monero rather than Botcoin and further that the 21 million hard limit will prove to be Bitcoin's very undoing."""

53,b'What about fees if XMR = $1000',9,"b'well, the beauty is that (currently) the transactions fees are not hardcoded as required for block inclusion consensus. Currently, they are ""network"" consensus - its a relay fee. A node will only relay a transaction if it has the proper fee.\n\nWhich I feel is kinda weird, its not like that node will see any of the fee. The node is sort of like ""yeah, your a good transaction because you are helping the system work and thats cool that I\'ll never really see an immediate benefit of that fee but I\'m a monero node so obviously if the network is doing good then I\'m doing good""\n\nthats how nodes talk. They ramble a lot. \n\nSo basically, what I\'m getting at, is that there is nothing stopping a zero fee transaction from getting into the blockchain. If you created a mining pool, and you had a shit ton of hash power, you could mine all the zero fee transactions you want.\n\nSo currently the consensus code allows for market dynamics for tx fees, its just that none of the pools have taken it upon themselves to create these markets.\n\nThus, as it stands, there is no fear of a take-over by any entity to impose limits on tx fees or to mandate some kind of tx fee minimum. \n\nRight now, the people you want to yell at are pool operators. \n\n\nLong story short, again.... if I had my druthers, and about a week of free time, and about a 30% increase in coding / sysops skills, I\'d like to start an experimental pool that would mine lowfee transactions. You would use it as a remote node to submit your transactions, and they would only be included in a block if the pool mined a block, and if your transaction had enough fee to beat out other txs in the pools txpool. Some of the work has already been done by another glorious member of our pirate ship of awesomeness. The yonder calls, and the frontier is only a limitation of knowledge. \n\nIt would cause a clusterfuck for your wallet, because you\'d probably get tired of waiting for a block and be like fuckit ima just submit a normal transaction but now you got this transaction already out so it\'ll just be a mess.\n\nBut thats good. A thing don\'t get better unless you break it. '"
53,b'What about fees if XMR = $1000',6,"b""> Monero\xe2\x80\x99s fees are mostly related to the block size which is dynamic. \n\nThis is actually wrong. Monero fees can vary by orders of magnitude even without any changes to the block size. We use a recommended multiplier system based on priorities, where the lowest priority is barely used right now. Anyone who wants to reduce their fees by 75% need only check a box in the GUI or add one word in the CLI wallet. The risk of doing so is that your transaction may take much longer to confirm or fail. Or it may not, and you will simply pay less fee. But that's a risk that not many are prepared to take right now.\n"""
53,b'What about fees if XMR = $1000',9,"b""If there isn't a high volume of transactions then it is being used as a form of (highly private) digital gold. In that case high TX fees are not a big deal at all. How much does it cost to move a ton of gold? How much does it cost to wire dollars between exchanges around the world?\n\nEven then the TX fees and block size are dynamic and if there is demonstrated demand for more capacity (users competing for block space by bidding up TX fees) then the block size will increase. If there is demand only for a small number of high value transactions, then that's what we will have."""

Because we do it for development and don't bitch and whine).\n\nIt's also worth noting that the more transactions happening with Monero, the cheaper they will become (for a bit). All the transactions are tumbled internally, a process easier to do with more transactions."""
53,b'What about fees if XMR = $1000',2,"b""Yes, I've been thinking about this as well.

That way, someone could fund BTC from fiat, convert to Monero, convert back to BTC in separate clean wallets with no root trace of source of funds, be used for a series of transactions, and if necessary, incoming or unspent BTC can be run through the anonymous exchange website a second time to convert that BTC to Monero, then back into a clean BTC wallet, and then that wallet can be cashed out to fiat.  In such a case, fiat/crypto exchange authorities, and by extension governments with subpoena powers, would only ever know about your funding and cashing-out.  None of the transactions between.'"

Ideally with Bitcoin, if you were doing some sort of fundraiser with it, for example, anyone can track the funds and see what they are being spent on. People responsible for other people\'s money can be held accountable because everyone can see what they are doing.\n2. Though a government can track which addresses control which Bitcoin, they cannot freeze bank funds, nor can your bank freeze your bitcoin funds. I recognize that the same can be said of Monero, but I\'m talking originally. '"

I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for all bitcoin maximalist, but I can speak for some:\nBitcoin is not any specific technology. Today\xe2\x80\x99s production Bitcoin is pretty basic as far as blockchain currencies go, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will stay that way. Bitcoin will continue to evolve, just maybe not as fast as crypto enthusiasts would like. But I firmly believe that bitcoin will incorporate all the best tech at a steady pace. One day many years from now I expect it will be possible to transact in BTC with as much or more privacy than Monero has today. It might be on a side chain or some other layer, but it will be possible none the less. Bitcoin maximalists don\xe2\x80\x99t look at today\xe2\x80\x99s bitcoin as the currency of the future, because in its current form it is woefully inadequate for such a task, but the bitcoin of 2025 just might be up to the task. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just an immutable ledger, it is an evolving immutable ledger and evolution is the only thing that can make it stand the test of time. If you listen to the FUD you might think that BTC has a \xe2\x80\x9cgovernance problem\xe2\x80\x9d and that no progress is being make on improving the protocol, but that is just patently false. While I think Monero has great devs (it is my second favorite crypto and will always have a place in my heart because of its principals), no crypto comes close to BTC with regards to the amount of quality work being put into the protocol, extensions and the ecosystem. Bitcoin will probably never have any of the newest blockchain features, but what bitcoin does offer is a really good functionality/stability ratio and features will only be added when everyone is certain that stability can be maintained. It may be a bit slow going but I believe that bitcoin will always dominate the crypto space. '"

42,b'Shameless plug: funding of Python module for Monero',1,"b'> Fully-automatic tests are quite difficult to set up in the environment which depends heavily on network behavior. Hence my idea that a testing suite would have educational value too. It would require the user to set up a couple of testnet wallets with minimal balance, then run the suite, having an opportunity to hop into the process with pdb (Python debugger) interface and interact with the test environment.\n\nWhat do you need a testnet setup for? I assume you\'re still making calls to `monero-wallet-rpc` for transaction related things, so you could just mock HTTP requests. I think it\'s actually easier to do unit tests for this kind of stuff because when manually testing, you actually do need a testnet setup.\n\nI don\'t like that the milestones are like ""M1: Implementation"", ""M2: Documentation & Tests"" because I think testing should be done while developing, not when the product is finished. I mean, they help with refactoring and all that. Personally I don\'t care if you have any milestones or not, but if you do, they should be about functionality.\n\nThat said, I think it\'s a great funding proposal.

Yes it's been addressed already but I think it's good to revisit often especially with the constant influx of new money into crypto. I see this as a 2 part question: 1) Would the government like to ban or harm monero? (I am undecided on this. Possibly they embrace anonymous crypto and love it for their own uses, or possibly they decide it's a threat to the status quo and they wish to ban/harm it as much as possible.) and 2) What could they do, to ban or harm monero, and how effective would it be? As far as I see, as long as there is some website, somewhere in the world, that exchanges Monero, you'd be able to use it for any crypto-related purchase. I am somewhat concerned that if the Powers-that-Be wanted to restrict Monero usage, they might have a variety of tactics to reduce its price. I'm not sure exactly what these tactics would be but the corporate ruling elite have some tricks up their sleeves for sure. I am concerned that the IRS will get their panties in a bunch at some point, not sure what they'll do about it. Sure, they're trying to audit coinbase right now, but as long as people aren't pulling fiat out there's not much they can do.

If I\'ve understood correctly, the blocks you receive from the pools are a meg, or two...? Hardly an impact on your bandwidth usage. \n\nNow banning for political purposes and requiring ISP\'s to comply through the criminal code... Sure.

Supply first. I don\'t have an emission rate data for ETN at the moment, so let\'s use Monero\'s emission rate, which shows that around 75% of max supply will be mined in 5 years (inclusive of premine), and the remaining 25% which will have greater difficulty will be mined in the following 30 years. Now we have 17.5 billion ETN in the year 2022.\n\nSupply is limited, demand is not. Let\'s analyse the coin with the biggest growth (demand) since a year ago. \n\nNEM\nSupply: 8,999,999,999 all pre-mined\nGrowth: 70x - 100x\nWallets with balance today: 44,495\n\nNEO\nSupply: 65,000,000 all pre-mined\nGrowth: 100x - 120x\nWallets with balance today: 88,147\n\nClearly, NEM and NEO both have very different supply count, but comparable growth. What drove the growth? Demand. They have more than a year headstart before Electroneum, and have less than 100k active wallets today respectively.\n\nNow compare that with ETN\'s 400,000 wallets. Let that sink in for a moment. Demand for ETN is over the roof! And the team hasn\'t even gone full force on increasing adoption yet! Imagine people sitting in a train/cafe/bar just sharing about Electroneum and all you need is a smartphone to get started. How easy is it for someone to jump in compared to using a computer? Humans are generally attracted to simple, convenient stuff that gives instant gratification. Mobile mining? Game? Seeing ETN in 2 decimals immediately on the app? That\'s instant gratification. \n\nEvents in the pipeline:\nsocial media campaign\nanimated explainer video\nvirtual currency exchange\nsend electroneum by messaging app\npartnership with gaming industry\nconsole mining\ntranslation in many languages\ninfluencer marketing\nhiring more professionals\ncelebrity endorsements\nonline voucher apss\njoint venture with other brands (crossover)\nwhitelabelling\nmarket Electroneum as the global cryptocurrency\ntarget millions of people with smartphones without bank accounts\n\nTim Draper said, ""My guess is that it will centralize around a wallet that you have, and when you pay for that Starbucks, your wallet will optimize to whichever currency has most value \xe2\x80\x94 If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get simplified it won\xe2\x80\x99t get adopted \xe2\x80\x94 good marketing people will simplify all use of these things.""\n\nWhich is more \xe2\x80\x98human\xe2\x80\x99? 1.20 ETN for a Starbucks latte or 0.00009420 BTC?\n\nSo we have a target year: 2022\nAn estimate circulating supply: 17.5 billion ETN\nHigher demand than the 2 best-performing coins for the past year: Top 6 achievable\n\nBack to crypto market cap in 2022, $5 trillion. Assuming Bitcoin is the defending champion and still reigning the market share, BTC will have a $2.9 trillion market cap. $2.1 trillion market cap is shared among all altcoins, including Electroneum. \n\n$0.10/ETN makes it #79 rank with $1.75 billion market cap\n$1/ETN makes it #16 rank with $17.5 billion market cap\n$10/ETN makes it #5 rank with $175 billion market cap\n$100/ETN makes it #2 rank with $1.75 trillion market cap\n\nWhich other coin is so laser-focused in achieving mass adoption? I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any at the moment. All other coins are just \xe2\x80\x98preaching to the choir\xe2\x80\x99 of the crypto community, pulling out tech dicks and shoving at each other\xe2\x80\x99s face showing who has better tech.

Though likely, liquidity and infrastructure development would suffer. \n\n2. due to the features of Monero, and the ability to use it with Kovri, Tor, I2P, etc - it shouldn't lose much utility. \n\n3. Not all governments all over the world will outlaw it simultaneously. There is real financial incentive, especially if you are a small government, to keep it legal if all the other countries have outlawed it. Imagine the money they'd make from the exchanges, etc \n\nBut let's say that this blockchain technology is so detrimental to power and control that it jeopardizes the very existence of government. It makes it impossible to collect taxes, to know who and how to tax, and if transactions are even happening, etc. \n\nSo this means that all governments outlaw it as much as possible because otherwise it's their absolute death. \n\nWell.. that likely wouldn't happen: Governments are not single cohesive entities aiming to achieve a specific goal.  Instead, they are composed of multiple people with multiple incentives and multiple, often contradictory goals. Most people in the government are rational and act in a way that benefits themselves the most, regardless of it's larger societal impacts. \nOrganizations of each government even compete with one another. \n\nWith that in mind, it maybe possible for many of the people that compose government organizations, and certain government organizations, to want Monero legal despite it being an existential threat to the entire government. Certainly Monero would appeal to those who are corrupt and want to steal funds from within the government. \n\nIf you're the NSA, FBI, or DEA - it is desirable to have monero being used on the darknet as it ultimately justifies your existence, and the bigger the darknet economy is, the more funding your organization will get, and you'll get more power and job security as an individual. \n\n\nSo, it's unlikely that the elite, or those that depend on it for job security/power will promote outlawing it completely. Rather, each organization from within the government will regulate it and pass laws that try to give them progressively more power over it, as that will benefit the individual government workers the most. \n\nThis won't turn out to well though, since it is completely private and anonymous and most/all of those laws will be unenforceable to a large extent. \nIn that hypothetical scenario where this blockchain technology is a huge threat to the government, the government will slowly evaporate. :P\n\nMaybe - I have no idea, just rambling, but maybe it'll provoke some interesting thoughts/discussion. \n\n\n"""

12,"b""Analysis on Crypto Market/Electroneum in a year's time.""",7,"b""Hi everyone, as you may have been aware of, Bitcoin has been gaining a lot of media attention lately. It's causing serious FOMO (fear of missing out) among people who have never delved in crypto before. Instead of 5 years, a lot of people have been asking what can happen in 1 year. So I'd like to share on the potential of Bitcoin/crypto within 1 year and how it affects Electroneum.  \n  \nThe chart shows a feedback loop of a cryptocurrency (in this case Bitcoin) with big Network Effects. If you can recall what I've shared before regarding Metcalfe's Law/Network Effect, the value of a network is the square of the total users in the network where N = number of users and N\xc2\xb2 = value of the network. In simpler words, the more users a coin has, the more valuable it is exponentially.  \n  \nBased on the BTC chart support trendlines, I've come up with a prediction range on its price in a year, which is $20k being the most conservative (assuming a lot of obstacles happened), to $80k and beyond. So in a year, we can expect the crypto market to grow by between 2x - 8x, and you can expect around that much of ROI (return on investments) if you are HODLing BTC for a year. And when this is projected to the crypto market cap it will be at least $730 billion ~ $2.5 trillion.  \n  \nNow market cap doesn't define a coin's price, in fact, it's the other way round. But market cap is a psychological barrier and does affect how a coin is being treated, bar the cultism from BTC diehard fans. You can safely assume that the higher the total market cap in crypto is, the more room a given coin can grow. And in this sense, Electroneum can grow anywhere up to $10 (with more than $150 billion in market cap) and still rank lower than BTC.   \n  \nIs this $1 ~ $10 realistic and achievable in a year? Yes. How about ETN at $50, $100 or even $1000??? Very unlikely, if not utterly impossible.  \n  \nAchievable how? Let's take a look at the population of some of the countries where ETN's mobile mining experience can take off virally:  \n  \nIndia - 1.26 billion  \nIndonesia - 258 million  \nNigeria - 186 million  \nPhilippines - 102 million  \nVietnam - 95 million  \nUK (Home) - 64 million  \nSouth Africa - 54 million  \n  \nA conservative number of viral apps is about 6% of the population (India's PayTM app has 10% market penetration).  6% of the market penetration in the above countries give Electroneum around 120 million users. This number is not even considering the crypto-active nations such as US, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea, who will trade ETN when it becomes popular.  \n  \nFor comparison, Bitcoin has 16 million users at the moment, give or take. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Electroneum's number of users overtake Bitcoin's. It's far too much easier to convince someone to download and use Electroneum's app immediately than Coinbase for a new user:  \n  \nCoinbase app  \n1) Needs ID verification  \n2) Needs Paypal/Bank Account/Credit or Debit Cards   \n3) Even if you have Bank Account, it takes 4-5 days to get it approved to get your first crypto  \n4) Limited to developed countries only  \n5) Most coins look weird compared to usual fiat currency (many decimals)  \n  \nElectroneum app  \n1) No ID verification  \n2) Start earning ETN without any payment  \n3) Transfer/Exchange ETN without Bank Account  \n4) Get ETN as your first crypto, immediately  \n5) Available to most countries, if not all (huge user base)  \n6) Looks natural with 2 decimals, easier to use for businesses/transactions  \n  \nThere you go, let's ride this baby for a year and these scenarios happen:  \n  \n1) Crypto market grows several times over. AND  \n2) The large majority of people who are left out in crypto start using Electroneum as their first crypto.  \n  \nWE ARE IN FOR ONE HELL OF A RIDE BABY!\n\n\n\n"""
6,b'Bundled Transactions?',3,"b""I'm generally unable to understand your idea:\n\n> Say you have 10 people/private keys who want to send their coins to 10 other people/private keys - this results in 10 transactions/outputs.\n\n> If they all did a mixn of 5, it would be: 10 transactions that each have 1 real and 5 mixins/decoys, and 1 output.\n\nA typical transaction destined to one recipient has two outputs, one going to the recipient and the other as change.\n\n> 10 private keys in 1 transaction, with 10 outputs, and with a mixin of 50.\n\nI don't understand this part, and I doubt it'll work. Do you mean the single transaction has one big ring of mixin 50 that has 10 real spent keys? I don't think such a signature scheme is possible (i.e. each ring signature can't have multiple key images).\n\nConceptually similar to CoinJoin, one could collect valid input ring signatures and output keys & range proofs generated by different individuals to form a one big transaction, but there won't be any space/compute savings. I also doubt about any privacy merit, since one can find which outputs come from which input(s) by comparing the sum of the input pseudoOuts and the sum of the output CT commitments.\n"""
6,b'Bundled Transactions?',1,"b""Also if this doesn't result in privacy loss, it would be very interesting to know how much bundling transactions could save blockchain space: As I understand it, bulletproofs and StringCT scale logarithmically - perhaps it could be possible to bundle so many transactions that the transaction size per private key spent from is equal in size to that of spending from a private key in Bitcoin?\n\nObviously, I don't know - but it'd be cool if this ultimately allowed for same/better privacy and better scaling. If it does the opposite, we might want to explore making it impossible to bundle transactions as it results in incentive for people to jeopardize privacy for reducing their transactional costs. """

Slowly, forward thinking rich people will start to move vast amounts of off-shore wealth into Monero to store as gold. Slowly more and more of the float will start to be locked up providing a positive feedback loop for more off-shore wealth to be moved into Monero. At some future point in time the price will mostly stabilize increasing in value more slowly due to it's disinflationary characteristics this making monero the perfect digital gold. At this point it will also widely be used as a transaction medium because it's also the best digital cash.

However, the guy that takes that sheep home can identify those sheep by their markings, fur shape, horns, etc. Also, your neighbors would know from whom you bought these cows, again by their fur markings. Maybe one cow is missing a horn, so that makes it super-identifiable. Everyone will know you bought cows from Amir the Persian Dude who isn't very welcomed in the village.\n\nOption B is to go to Amir the Persian Dude and sell your sheep for gold. Gold is fungible, because you can take Amir's Persian golden coins, melt them, and cast that gold into Roman coins. No one can notice the difference, and no one will find out that Amir paid you. Next weekend you take Roman coins to the market, and use them to buy 2 cows from a guy from a village north.

3,b'Electroneum mobile miner will fail?',1,"b""Here is a wild what if, purely for entertainment:\n\nWhat if the simulated gammified mobile mining is backed up by a real centralized mining operation by ETN devs themselves?\n\n-  This helps secure ETN blockchain;\n-  This allows ETN devs to profit from mining and trading other cryptocoins;\n\n-  This helps ETN devs to persuade gamers to join the community by enabling them to earn ETN coins while playing multiplayer games;\n-  This allows partners of ETN devs in the gaming industry to persuade more gamers to play their games using ETN coins - Many of ETN's gaming industry partners are probably spending a lot on advertising and customer acquisition campaigns already anyway;\n-  Their partners would most likely be betting on some of those gamers pumping value into their wallets and also into the ETN community by purchasing ETN coins for their games, one way of which is for those gamers to trade fiat and other cryptocoins for ETN so as to access their products - After all, they're gamers, and ETN's gaming industry partners are selling games;\n\n-  This helps ETN devs to persuade online gamblers to join the community by enabling them to earn ETN coins while playing casino / poker games;\n-  This allows partners of ETN devs in the online gambling industry to persuade more online gamblers to play their casino / poker games using ETN coins - Many of ETN's online gambling industry partners are probably giving away crazy sign-up bonuses and the like already anyway;\n-  Their partners would most likely be betting on some of those online gamblers pumping value into the ETN community by purchasing ETN coins for their casino / poker games, one way of which is to trade fiat and other cryptocoins for ETN coins - After all, they're online gamblers, and ETN's online gambling industry partners are profiting from their casino / poker games;\n\n-  This could keep miners happy with a robust community of ETN users, left and right; and\n-  This could possibly trigger wider adoption across other markets and community groups around the world.\n\nNow, this crazy what if is primarily based on the following things:\n\n1.  ETN devs are mostly marketing experts, so I for one expect a viable / sustainable back end marketing structure;\n2.  They also announced they'll be mainly focusing on the gaming and online gambling markets;\n3.  ETN devs also announced that their main goal is market traction and wide-scale adoption; and\n4.  They also announced that there'll be a centralized mining operation done by ETN devs themselves, and I think this'll be their own pool that's set up solely for their mobile miners, a.k.a. Users of their simulated gammified mobile mining app, which is probably designed as a loss leader that could help them significantly reduce their user acquisition costs and also significantly increase market traction, interest and adoption across their target groups.\n\nWhat do you think of this wild what if? I just tried tackling the common questions that a lot of users interested in ETN have from a 50 / 50 perspective of a digital marketer and a technologist with experience in relevant industries. I run and own a 12-year old digital multimedia marketing company with multilingual phone support, SEO and Web marketing departments.

It's very smart aggressive marketing and they do it very well.  I think it's very viable they can at least half of what they plan to do and that's enough for it to be huge. \nThey can easily get in for independently made/owned game transactions and certain services etc since it is modeled after monero a privacy coin but with 2 decimals.  There's another new ico coin trying to copy etns game currency model, but ya know first movers advantage is huge. I think it will work because game devs want to move users to in game transactions and it's really easy to obtain ETN for now.  So in the long term game players will be purchasing etn from them and developers make more money."""

9,b'Fome on Steam',1,"b'IMO Bytecoin is currently in the best possible position to take Bitcoin\'s place for transactions on Steam and here\'s why.\n\n- ASIC-Resistant \n\nThis makes the currency a much more viable option for people who wish to mine on the network and actually make a profit. Other coins like Litecoin and Ethereum all run into the issue of being dominated by expensive ASiC miners which in this current time I believe is a big no-no. ASIC miners make it much more difficult for newcomers into the network. Cryptonight-based currencies are in a much better position due to the fact that people don\'t have to dump hundreds of dollars into specific mining hardware.\n\nI think what people forget is that you are literally doing nothing but leaving your computer running. If your expecting large sums of cash to just magically fall into your lap then you have the wrong idea of how crytocurrencies are suppose to work.\n\n- Lower hash rates can still generate a ton of coins\n\nThis is something that actually keeps me invested in Bytecoin myself. You can easily mine within a day 180 BCN at 300 H/s at current difficulty in MG pool. Since you are playing with pennies on the dollar you can easily play the market and easily make tens to hundreds more BCN simply by trading and it can all start with that first 180. The one thing I hated about other coins was unless you had above .9 of the coin you were not going to make much of a trade making the market useless to newcomers. Current exchanges limit BCN buy/sell at 10 BCN minmum which IMO makes it much more appealing (and more closely resembles buying and selling stocks) at the current moment. \n\n- Low market value \n\nAt the current value it\'s not impossible to profit $10 within 3-5 months of mining at 300 H/s. Other currencies do not even come close with the same hashrate. This makes Bytecoin a much more viable option for newcomers especially to people who are just getting into the cryptomarket themselves. This also ties into my first point of being ASiC-resistant that nobody should just *expect* that money is just going to fall into their lap just for running their computer. If that was the case then every server administrator would be a billionaire (World record uptime of a server is 16 years).\n\n- 184 Billion Max Supply\n\nThis high number of total available coins means that there is a greater likelihood that users will hold more than .1 of the currency. It also means that it is less susceptible to large value shifts like we have seen with Bitcoin (eg: $17,000 back down to below $15,000 with hours). This means that in terms of availability and scalability Bytecoin is unmatched. There is currently only one cryptocurrency with a larger maximum circulation size and that is FedoraCoin (4.43 billion) however it is based and Script and IMO does not meet the ASIC-resistant requirements necessary to protect CPU miners.\n\n\n\nI hope Bytecoin developers do open up communications with Valve so we can get the ball rolling here. I feel that we are in a very unique position and would hate to see BCN lose this fast closing opportunity to show the world that it is more than just ""some scam coin"" and actually is a coin worth so much more than people currently view it.\n'"

But at the same time, shit needs to happen before the hype-train dies.\n\nIf they're not gonna make it by 12/14, I'd expect an announcement by next Monday letting us know that. If they either don't have a new target within that announcement or they have one, but fail to hit it (say, they tell us Jan 3rd and Jan 3rd comes and they push it back to Jan 15th or whatever) then I will probably bounce unless they have a damn good reason as to why."""

5,b'What is the value of owning Monero?',3,"b""> Why should I buy some Monero? (I have the same question on ETH) Outside of it growing in value and me being able to sell it; I can't think of reasons.\n\nMy personal reason is, so that I can buy mind altering plants. I usually purchase a little bit more than I'd spend so I'm having a tiny piggy bank on the side for the spare change. Up until the AlphaBay bust, I thought that I could easily just use BTC (how naive)... Anyhow, did some research, found out that this is nearly the only coin that has privacy by default and I can sleep easier at nights.\n\n> are there other reasons that make it a good investment now?\n\nPrivacy by default, if you invest in it, nobody will know how much you have. If you'd buy BTC for investment purposes, then others could find out the exact amount you store in your wallet. Not good.\n\nBut you confuse me... Do you want reasons for investment (as in stated in your Edit), or other reasons that have nothing to do with investment (like real-life use cases)?\n\nRegarding investment, you already stated the simplest one. The price. I consider Monero quite undervalued and looking where BTC got these days even with its broken wings, it's a perfect time to buy some XMR and, well, HODL. If you want to invest, why would you want to wait for mainstream adoption? Your two paragraphs contradict each other. I'd guess you invest before adoption to be ahead of the curve."""

13,b'What is the max Circulating Supply of Monero?',2,"b'There are two things that bother me with such a question.\n\n1. Bitcoin will have a maximum of 21 million coins, that is true. However, when that happens you and I will be long dead by then. Therefore the number of coins for Bitcoin that we are going to have to work with in our lives are less than that. Personally, I find it very hard to know how things will be in a year from now and I consider all financial planning extending to more than 10 years in the future complete humbug. We may be able to get 40 year loans to buy houses but it is impossible to know if we will ever be able to repay them or not. For Monero, the max supply is infinite, but keep in mind that our sun and earth will only be around for 5 billion years more so no infinity of Moneros, sorry. The right question would be something like ""how many Moneros are going to be generated in 10 years time?"" and the same applies to Bitcoin too.\n2. ""the supply will go down and price will increase"". What is wrong with all these people trying to find value in scarcity? If I start a new coin but with only one coin ever mined, will I be a trillionaire or something? Scarcity is only a measure of poorness and reflects an ideology of wanting more at the expense of our neighbours. Yes, I am all aware of the scarcity economic theories. I just happen to prefer working in the direction of abundance. Making sure that Monero is available to all and is usable money is a much more enjoyable (and immensely more profitable) endeavour. Of course, it takes work and faith to get there. Serpents lay eggs and that\'s as much time as they waste on their children. Mammals spend time and effort taking care of their children. Now, consider which of these two has now the power to ""kill"" our planet in a few different ways.\n\nTo answer your question, Monero will have a max circulating supply worth worrying about of approximately 18-19 million coins. Better than Bitcoin, if that counts for anything.'"

12,b'[QUESTION] Does a view-only wallet show the TRUE balance?',1,b'(edited / thanks JPaulMora and moneroguru)\n\nYes. The balance shown with a view key can be higher than the actual balance. It is inferred from your incoming transactions by scanning all transactions in the blockchain with your view key. The balance does not account for outgoing transactions though. So it is only reliable as a maximum possible balance (the upper bound).'

OTOH the vertical alignment on the rightmost side can happen by chance because the decoy selection algorithm is more likely to pick one of the most recent outputs.\n\nThis issue, often called ""temporal alignment"", is inevitable when your unspent outputs span only a small time period in the past. It\'s therefore generally a good idea to not spend many outputs at once. One way to circumvent this alignment issue is to `transfer` some smaller amount or `sweep_single` to yourself to get fresh outputs.\n\nAnyway, this is a rather deep and open-ended discussion topic, so I\'d not argue for the validity of my thought :)\n'"

It is therefore impossible for anyone you transact with to discover anything else about your transactions.\n\nThe only thing to think about is the public receiving address you use. Have one account for exchanges, one for personal, one for business, one for porn, etc. Sending money does not reveal the public receiving address only receiving as you have to publish something for people to pay you.\n\nIf you are super paranoid, send one more hop after exchange.

The KYC policies of exchanges are the only thing you have to worry about being linked to you.\n\nMonero itself is completely untraceable and private. The only point of failure so to speak is when you give up all of your information to the exchanges. So, if you want to be 100% anonymous and have nobody know you own it, wait for decentralized exchanges or buy it from an individual. '"

If a mutli-billion dollar company like Blizzard can release a wow expansion and have server issues, I don't expect the one of the biggest ICOs to go off without a hitch. Blizzard still has issues and they have had years to learn/correct them. The ETN team probably didn't expect this to blow up like it did. I am just glad that when they found out how popular they were becoming(a target for hackers), they took the steps to secure themselves.  \nThey also tried to account for the high traffic rates by outsourcing it to a well known company like Amazon. With just the name I would have expected them to handle the server scaling, but they didn't. You can't put all the blame on ETN for the congested traffic when they are paying Amazon to account for that. \nOn the bright side, you will probably make more money by not being able to sell now. \nI am an ICO investor, I have my coins.

5,b'Hi there. I am a newbie here and want to ask something about Monero vs Zcash.',13,"b'My issue with Zcash is that it was created by a for profit organization with a CEO. For me, that goes against everything a privacy coin should stand for. Further, I don\'t like the way the ""Ceremony"" was done because there is a chance (albeit a tiny one) that the ""masterkey"" can still exist.\n\nOh, and Zcash is only really private if BOTH sender and receiver opt for a private transaction. In Monero this is on by default.\n\nPersonally I greatly prefer Monero as it doesn\'t have any of the issues that Zcash does but accomplishes the same goal.'"
5,b'Hi there. I am a newbie here and want to ask something about Monero vs Zcash.',7,"b'Monero is. Here\'s a pretty high level overview explaining why:\n\n\nZCash has transparent addresses and shielded addresses, as explained here: https://z.cash/technology/index.html. ZCash transactions that are sent between 2 transparent addresses work like Bitcoin; they are publicly linkable and trackable. Transactions sent between 2 shielded addresses use a cryptographic technique called zero knowledge proofs. In ZCash, these are named zk-SNARKS. They allow a transaction to be made without exposing the parties or amounts involved to the blockchain, which is how ZCash achieves privacy. Additionally, ZCash can be sent from a shielded address to a transparent address and vice versa. However, this type of transaction can be linked, so should not be used where privacy is desired.\n\nThe problem is that shielded addresses are optional. This means that in practice, the overwhelming majority of ZCash transactions are performed with transparent addresses (especially from exchanges) and are not private.\n\nIn Monero, privacy is obtained through the use of ring signatures, which is explained here: https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringsignatures.html. This means that other outputs are mixed into your transaction, making it extraordinarily difficult for an observer to determine which of the outputs in the ring is actually sending Monero. So, someone observing the blockchain may know that someone out of a ring of 5 was sending Monero somewhere, but not which of those is sending it. On top of this, Monero uses stealth addresses to hide the recipient\'s address from appearing on the blockchain, and ring confidential transactions to hide the amount being sent.\n\nCrucially, none of this is optional in Monero; there is no ""un-private"" mode to use by accident. '"
5,b'Hi there. I am a newbie here and want to ask something about Monero vs Zcash.',2,"b'How do you define reliability?

36,b'Have another perspective about Electroneum supply and decimal points! (RE-POST/reformat)',1,"b'Dang, you pretty much wrote a doctoral dissertation with that.  Great stuff, good work.\n\nMy way of thinking about ETN versus BTC with supply and decimals is that with BTC, it\'s basically more like gold.  BTC with its 8 decimals and 21million max supply is more of a digital asset of storage with its ability to divide down further, but its more cumbersome to ""spend"" which makes it look more like a ponzi as well.\n\nWith ETN, it\'s made to be more like a casino chip. But the cool thing about this casino chip is that that it can increase in value rather than just being the $1 or $5 dollar chip you got at the casino that just stays at $1 or $5 forever until you trade the chip in.  \n\nSo with ETN, it was created with features for it to function as a currency while at the same time with features for it to function as a digital asset of storage.  That would be like having casino chips to gamble with that can also change in value as well, but yet be able to spend at gaming & retail sites too.  That would be one fun casino chip!!\n\nWith that, you\'re not going to see $20,000 ETN coins like you would a BTC coin.  But with mass adoption and use and demand, I don\'t see why it couldn\'t be a $100 ETN chip. \n\nI think all arguments and counter arguments made here are valid.  I think it\'s one of those ""experiments"" that can turn out wildly successful or not.  It will take mass adoption for it to be successful though, and it will be a long slow climb up to $100.  You\'ll just have to buy more ETN if you want to make more $ on selling.  But then again, if you buy more ETN, that would drive up demand which then would drive up price, right?  It\'s such an interesting dynamic.  Hell, we might end up with a situation where there is less correlation between circulating supply and price as compared to other coins. '"
36,b'Have another perspective about Electroneum supply and decimal points! (RE-POST/reformat)',0,"b'Your argument for point 1 is invalid.  You\'re saying that because ETN can be divided into a smaller number of transactional units it has a lower total supply.  Total supply isn\'t determined by transactional units.  If the US announced tomorrow that half of the pennies in circulation would be retired and replaced with .001 coins the total money supply would remain unchanged.  Less transactional units means nothing.\n\nPoint 2 - The decimal point IS a flaw.  Businesses may adapt if the price goes over $1.  But $10? $100?  Say I want to buy a soda from a vending machine for 50 cents.  I\'m not going to ""adapt"" by paying double (the smallest possible transaction would $1 @ $100 value per coin).\n\nPoint 3 - The reason no one cares about USD only going to two decimal points is that a penny is already basically worthless.  The smallest transactional unit of USD works because it\'s the smallest amount we believe is worth tracking.  Back to the $100 example, the smallest transactional unit of ETN would be worth $1.  People care about $1.  $1 isn\'t going to be shrugged off as a rounding variance like a penny will.\n\nArgument 4 - Technology absolutely affects the price of crypto in the long run.  Bitcoin has the highest market cap because it\'s viewed as the first and the most stable for investors.  The real world usage of bitcoin for transactions is very low.  People are using it as a speculative vehicle so the technology behind it is irrelevant.  In the long run crypto only survives if it can gain mass adoption.  At that point the technology is very relevant.  The coin with the best tech and best marketing will achieve the greatest adoption and therefore the highest market cap.\n\n'"

Once the paper wallet has been exposed to the web it is no longer as secure and really is just the same as using your online wallet at that point. The security of the paper wallet is that is has not been exposed to the web.'"
4,b'Downsides to paying out mining to paper wallet?',3,"b'I actually use neither...I prefer the command line wallet. That tool can be downloaded in the ""direct mining package"" on their website (it\'s the one that includes the node daemon).\n\nIt\'s more flexible than a paper wallet, but not a web/cloud wallet. You can avoid the web wallet entirely and just send however many coins you want directly from your wallet to the destination wallet. It\'s ""offline"" in the sense that your coins and wallet don\'t end up on someone else\'s server (provided the PC on which it\'s used is properly secured), but still ""online"" enough that you can sync it and check the balance. The files can of course be moved to external disks and detached from the PC for longer term storage. Sort of a middle ground between paper (completely offline, high security, but limited function) and web wallet (someone else storing your coins for you).\n\nDownside is you need the node daemon running and 6GB of disk space for the blockchain.'"

First, your money is vulnerable to the hidden tax of money printing which means your money loses value every year depending on how much money your government decides to print. Second, your money is vulnerable to bank bail-ins. This is not discussed much but was widely passed as law so that governments will not be required to bail out failing banks in the future. Third, you are not allowed to spend the money you have in the bank as you please. You must get permission from your bank to spend it. If they do not approve of where you want to spend it, they block you. Banks and fiat are destroying the world economy.

Never had an issue with either, I use Binance only to buy Neo due to no fees, but I mostly use Bittrex due to higher volume and much faster filled orders. Also, if there's any way to pair it with fiat, that will definitely help to push that coin away from BTC dominance. \n\n\nI move money in and out of Bittrex with no problems.  I also got enhanced verification on my 2nd attempt. I would use Bittrex over many of the smaller exchanges available at the moment. Literally any exchange can get hacked, go bankrupt, or pull an exit scam. People want unregulated market, and as soon as they encounter the things they were warned over and over about, they cry about it. \n\nAny exchange comes with risks. Someone new sees the Coinbase and Bittrex issues going on and starts parroting the same things without having issues. This is definitely not the case for some, and to those that have legitimate problems I am not directing this towards you. \n\nThe flavor of the week for the scammer comments is Bittrex.

Other coins have teams that are unknown individuals with no connections.  As time goes on, ETN will establish partnerships which will lead to wider adoption and use.\n\nI remember the days of when search engines were a new thing.  There were search engines such as: Yahoo, Excite, Lycos, NorthernLights, Google, AOL, etc.  Back then, in my opionion, Excite and Yahoo were better search engines than Google.  Google was just a stupid white page with a search box.  So why did Google become the billion dollar company it is?  Because their team was tied in with Hollywood and mainstream media outlets. The mainstream media started using the phrase ""I googled..."" into movies and tv shows. It became the only search engine talked about in the mainstream media.  So, that is the search engine the general public adopted even though at the time, it was a shitty search engine.  The team had connections.\n\nETN team has a good idea behind their coin and some connections with industry along with a proven track record of success with other ventures. I believe it\'s just going to take a long time though.

Pretty much every method involves changing it into Bitcoin before being able to sell it into dollars. (You said you are new but I would assume you know what Bitcoin is). Most people use Coinbase.com, although some people have been avoiding it lately as they are being investigated for insider trading. Another option that people have been suggesting is Gemini. Lastly the only other place I know of that will let you withdraw/deposit from bank is Kraken.\n\n4. They seem like pretty decent specs. If you know the hash rate for your hardware, some pools have a box to enter your hash rate and it will tell you how much XMR/day you will get. The thing to note about Minergate is that people say they steal your hashrate. So if you have 1000 hash rate, it might show 700 or whatever and only give you the profit for that much, when you should be getting more.'"

Why do I need to do this to set up my wallet?',2,"b'The daemon is the process the runs invisibly behind the GUI (or the command line in case you are using that). It keeps the entire blockchain synchronized and checks the integrity.\n \nThe blockchain is the accumulated transaction history of Monero (or any other blockchain based currency, such as Bitcoin). Your wallet can access a slice of this history with its secret keys and compiles its own history of transactions and thereby its balance from that data.\n \nMonero has accumulated 37GB of blockchain data thus far. Your system stores this in the ""bitmonero"" folder. Whenever new block are added to the blockchain, the daemon will make sure these are added to your copy as well. Don\'t worry, this will not take as long as the initial sync.\n \nIt is always best to have your own copy of the blockchain, but in case your device is not up for it, you can sync with a remote node. That saves some downloading and allows you to sync your wallet from a certain ""blockheight"". This skips a part of the history where there were no transactions relevant to your wallet.'"

In january the mobile app is supposed to launch for IOS which means it will then activate the mobile miner on both platforms for everyone to mine ( it's already released on android ) currently the app is technically only a wallet and shows the value of the coin as well. Also in January I believe more exchanges will hop on board as well. The aim in Jan18 is to get people to mass adobt ETN ( or crypto ) but ETN is going to be the coin to do it, especially from 3rd world countries etc where it could actually provide a better income then the pennies they make now.

The leading coin, whatever it is, could be taking about $4 trillion, and the 2nd and 3rd coin probably $1 trillion, and the rest distributed down the ranks.  \n  \nElectroneum is easily a top 5 coin due to its ability to amass users virally compared to other coins. Number of users = king. At a $1 trillion valuation with 10 billion circulating supply, it's around $100/ETN.  \n  \nLet's say Electroneum does worse than that, maybe getting 10x less than that at $100 billion valuation and ranking somewhere in the top 30. That's still $10/ETN.  \n  \nAs for what's coming, iOS release, mobile miner, tons of partnerships. At the moment there's already a few partnerships **signed**, with one of them commanding around 50 million smartphone users. Richard Ells (CEO) said there'll be a big recruitment campaign to start the new year so they'll be getting more manpower and professionals too.

As /u/rancemo already posted Monero wallet files are created in your user\'s `Documents\\Monero` folder if you don\'t specify a different path / folder yourself (which you could always do of course if you want).\n\nThe Monero wallets don\'t do any kind of ""wallet tracking"".

22,b'**Community Official Q&A** 12/27/17',3,"b'-What are the specific ""hold ups"" when it comes to getting listed on the more reputible exchanges? All we have heard is ""we\'re working on it."" It seems like a coin in the top ten for volume should have no trouble getting listed... It\'s also vital to follow the roadmap and entering markets outside the US.\n\n- We\'ve all noticed how vague the spokes people are when it comes to answering our questions. Why? I understand it\'s a privacy crypto but it makes us nervous when we are trusting thousands of dollars to individuals that we can\'t even relate a face to. Maybe pictures and a bio? Even if it\'s just a spokesman, a YouTube channel could go a long way. What specific skills do team members have? How much experience?\n\n- the last roadmap was updated after the deadline was missed. Would it be possible to have milestones that lead to each goal? Instead of "" reach asian markets"", have step 1,2,3,4 to reach asain markets we have completed one and two, now we have to xyz.\n\n-Does anyone involved with BCN have experience in business? I think it\'s safe to say that you guys know about programming. But what about running a multi million dollar Enterprise? \n\n- How are you planning to reach other markets? Do you have someone fluent in Korean, Japanese, Chinese etc? Are you hiring marketing firms? Are you just trying to get on exchanges that are available in this markets?\n\n- have there been any talks of partnering with other cryptos? If we solve a large problem like micro-transactions or scalability, why wouldn\'t BCN partner with other coins that aren\'t direct competitors. It\'s much harder for a business alliance to fail than it is for a single company.\n\nI\'ll end with this: A person is smart, but people are stupid. Individually we see the potential of bytecoin. When everyone is kept in the dark people get together and start throwing accusations around that become contagious and detrimental to the future. It\'s easy to gloss over problems and expect the next shiny release to distract people but, eventually,  all the shine fades and the problems have built up. Let\'s put some action to that transparency statement.\n\nEdit: have there. Sorry I\'m on my phone.'"
22,b'**Community Official Q&A** 12/27/17',3,"b""Guys, I've made a comments on top-5 questions mentioned at the list above:\n\n1. With the 1st and 2nd quarter I see on the roadmap a focus on the Asian and Middle East markets. Are there any specific details as to which markets/exchanges the team is looking into?\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to focus on these two markets for several obvious reasons - Bytecoin isn\xe2\x80\x99t so widely spread in these regions and there are a lot of investors who\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to invest in Bytecoin as soon as it\xe2\x80\x99ll be available in their region. Again, the regions we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to set our focus on weren\xe2\x80\x99t chosen accidentally. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of launching local communities in the Asian market (Korea and China) and making contacts with several services. Hopefully, this opportunity will be quite successful and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to proceed on moves into the Middle East market (of course, considering the region\xe2\x80\x99s specifics). \n\n2. Are there any plans to get featured on Coinbase or other similar exchanges for US customers? What's holding Byte back on achieving these exchange/market goals?\n\nOf course, one of the main goals in our marketing vector is to get Bytecoin listed on more exchange platforms. The daily trading volume which was set up this December gives us more opportunities to be considered by the exchange platforms we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on. And of course we are planning to get featured on Coinbase and other major exchanges. However, one has to know that the process of communication with the new partners is quite complicated. In some cases exchanges require too much of a deposit for a listing (10 BTC or even more), some exchanges just can\xe2\x80\x99t implement CryptoNote-based coins because of its difficult technology infrastructure. However, there\xe2\x80\x99s a way on how to speed up the listing process - create several tickets on the exchange platforms you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Bytecoin on. In this case the exchange platform you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at will pay more attention to us.\n\n3. Are there any details on the progress of a more secure wallet for IOS/Android?\n\nYes, definitely. We\xe2\x80\x99re planning to add the availability of importing and exporting private keys to the mobile apps. Moreover, we\xe2\x80\x99re POC that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made has shown that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to build a zero-trust wallet on a mobile client.\n\n4. Any openings in the future for help on the Development Team or elsewhere? If so, what roles are you looking for the most?\n\nQuite soon we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the opportunity to help the Development Team by testing the new software and acting as contributors to the software code. However, some cool enthusiasts from our community are now acting as contributors by developing the new and necessary tools (payment plugins, telegram bots, running the new full nodes, mining pools). These actions are making the  Bytecoin ecosystem much more user friendly and giving the Dev Team the time and opportunity to focus on the main code base.\n\n5. What is/was the problem with the transaction issues on all the exchanges? Was it the fault of BCN, the Exchanges or both? (As people continue to receive the coins, I will modify or get rid of this all together).\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated earlier, the problem with the exchanges was caused by fraudulent DDOS attacks on the Bytecoin network. We\xe2\x80\x99ve fixed everything on the behalf of our side and it seems that the network works pretty stably. Some issues still remain (Poloniex and Changelly still haven\xe2\x80\x99t fixed their software), however, these are only a question of time.\n"""

It means that the owner knows a number.  Among the many things cryptocurrency ""disrupts"" is the very idea of ownership, as it solidifies an isomorphic equivalence between asset ownership and knowledge of a fact.\n\nThink about this from the standpoint of the lawmaker/regulator.  So knowledge of a number that unlocks Monero is to be made illegal -- but the knowledge of a different number that unlocks, say, Bitcoin, is to remain legal?  How would you write that into legislation?  What do you do when Monero forks to notMonero as others mention?  \n\nFurthermore, how do you write the new ""ban"" in such a way that will stand up to judicial review?

23,b'zk-SNARK vs RingCT',30,"b'The Monero Research Lab is looking into it, but definitely without a trusted setup, like Zcash and others. According to the latest Monthly report of Sarang Noether: ""Finally, a new paper was released on efficient zk-SNARKs without trusted setup. Earlier work on zk-SNARKs required trusted parties, and some coins already use this. Monero\'s philosophy of privacy means that a trusted setup is an automatic no-no, which makes the new paper so interesting since it assumes no trusted parties. I have been working through the whitepaper and plan to write up a simulation if it continues to show promise. A comprehensive analysis of the potential space and computation costs is also in order, and this will continue into next month. Again, there are no immediate plans to switch to a zk-SNARK setup in Monero, but the technology is interesting and merits ongoing investigation."" \n\nhttps://forum.getmonero.org/8/funding-required/89005/funding-for-sarang-at-mrl-for-q1-2018?page=&noscroll=1#post-93863\nEDIT: like Zcash and others'"
23,b'zk-SNARK vs RingCT',19,"b'RingCT is more than ""good enough"": it is actually very good.\n \nZero knowledge proofs have some great potential, and Monero research lab is looking into potential applications. Sadly zk-SNARKS is currently not suitable for use in a currency as it requires a trusted setup and prohibitively large resources to create a transaction. \n \nWhile those may be optimized to some degree, there are other zero knowledge implementations that look a lot more promising.'"
23,b'zk-SNARK vs RingCT',6,"b""zk-SNARKs as they currently exist have such large space and computational requirements that ZCash would be unusable if it were required for all transactions. Default privacy is a necessary requirement for providing strong privacy guarantees and it should be clear that privacy is broader that just what the technology offers.\n\nMonero's privacy is broader than RingCT. Properly, it's ring signatures + ringCT + stealth addresses. Soon, Kovri will be added to that list.\n\nIf you have expertise or domain knowledge in how governments track their targets (blockchain analysis) you see that Monero is designed to resist this extremely well. It is such a well-crafted solution that it is workable today as a default-only policy.\n\nIf zk-SNARKs were created today Monero's design would not have been different, because zk-SNARKs are not ready at any scale and may never be. Those technologies are years away from being workable. However, when that time comes, if it makes sense it will be incorporated into Monero. The value of Monero is not strictly the technology but the team. If Monero needed to be completely rewritten, I would not be concerned for the future of the project. It's the team and community that really make the project, and the current technology that exists today is just a byproduct of that."""

Also, and this is purely speculation on my part, I think people try to dissuade you of any alt coin that they themselves are not invested in (since if you invest in coin A, and they have coin B, then coin B doesn't get the benefit of a new user and it doesn't go up).\n\nIs this something you should worry about? Only if your goal is to pump and dump (buy/mine a big chunk of the coin and wait until it's worth money then sell it all for profit), which unfortunately many people hope to do as a get rich quick scheme.

Will be put on Next Exchange - correct or did they pull out? (when this go live)\n\n3.) When the coin gets put on other exchanges should quickly shoot up.\n\nMost coins do. It depends on the exchange. Its getting harder to get on an exchange tho. Its not like it was just a few months ago. The problem is what happens when the pump stops and your coin is just like 100 other coins out there.\n\n4.) Even if mining doesnt work, it's still a mobile platform to buy and sell using crypto.\n\n\nTheres many wallets that can already do that. Im not sure why thats a touted feature.\n\n\n\nWhy not to buy?\n\n1) Heard this is the biggest scam as the mining doesn't work on phone.\n\n\nIts SIMULATED mining.

Is it really that much? Will the coin only be a few cents or will it go up to $1 to $5?\n\n\nI dont  know. I dont think that it will be where, say Litecoin is because theres no real uniqueness of the coin. For example, look at Quantstamp and what service the coin provides and try to find a coin that does the same. It will be very hard to do so.\n\nOr, say Centra. While Centra might seem generic and like the other coins, they also offer a WORKING crypto card, will be having their OWN exchange, and will be having their own blockchain. Theres only ONE other company i know that has all three and that company is not even in the ICO yet.\n\n\nA lot of questions for this coin. I want to invest, is a great time as low price but I want a coin that is going to work long term but now too --- too many good coins to invest in something that will be 8 cents the next 2 months but eventually moon.\n\nSee where I'm coming from?

If you want to view the wallet, you may always make a view only wallet so that your seed will not get compromised.\n\nTails linux is one of the best. It\'s always run from usb stick directly, so you don\'t even have to mess with your ""main"" operating system. However setting up a node on Tails may require some tweaking (but is definitely doable with little searching in Monero subreddit). If you have two computers, you can use the other one to run the node and then the Tails one to connect to the one that\'s running the node. You can always also use remote nodes. Just search for remote node or moneroworld in this subreddit.\n\nOutside of that any linux distro should do. Just be careful in general with the computer you keep you wallet\'s on if you decide to store your coins on hot wallets. Also use uBlock if you are using Firefox. Not sure if Chrome has similar kind of blocking software for extra security.'"

I understand that Bytecoin was the very first implementation of the CryptoNote algorithm, but there should at least be a disclaimer to clarify this. The technical documentation page could also use a revamp, to really explain how this coin is better than all the other top 20 cryptos.

I'm going to paste the answer you got from the support staff below, since it only involved information you posted yourself publicly.**   \n    \nWe have no recollection of your order because it was purged already, but checking the BTC blockchain with the address you gave, your order was processed without issue, see transaction https://blockchain.info/tx/fd98ea5cf38ef1a4f011da8da770217d59690779a1c3621c376cc0712f7964e0 which is the payment from xmr.to you refer to. (We checked and the BTC address involved do belong to our wallet).   \n   \nA bit of detective work, it's all a bit fuzzy on the minutes and block time and all that (can't do better since your order is purged and we can just use public information from XMR and BTC blockchain), but you can see:   \n\n* The XMR transaction confirmed in a block at 2018-01-07 03:02:42 https://xmrchain.net/search?value=af6544c646942c839bd343fbbc0c74e65d13d555cf11e618986dc0138443b304    \n\n* The BTC transaction confirmed in a block at 03:04:28 at https://blockchain.info/tx/fd98ea5cf38ef1a4f011da8da770217d59690779a1c3621c376cc0712f7964e0   \n   \nSo it seems your order was executed very quickly, which is consistent with our policy of sending out transactions instantly below 0.1 BTC.   \n   \nWe would advise to contact the recipient (newegg) and tell them the transaction ID.   \nNo clue why they didn't accept your transaction right away, but it definitely seems to be on their side.   \n"""

The scarcity and value would end up making it a coin nobody would bother with, and then there would be no demand and no partnerships.  Think about it, the partners might want to buy large quantities of ETN themselves to hold as well.  And those companies might have $$millions to sink into it.

When you later on spend that change again using the xwallet, it will show again 3 outputs. \n\n\nSo if I could make one suggestion: don\'t charge using this system. Either ask for a small amount to install the wallet, charge a monthly/yearly subscription, charge for premium features or charge to make more than 5 payments per month or something. \n\n\nAnother option would be to charge a fee when you deposit money: when you deposit the user gets a popup to ""make the deposit available"" by sending out the fee to xwallet and the user will receive the money in his wallet as ""spendable"". So the fee is paid up front. When a new deposit happens, this process repeats. \n\n\nedit: additional benefit: this would be a ""churn"". So if you receive directly from an exchange, the money is churned once before you spend it. It\'s actually better for privacy :)\n\n\nedit2: this system for charging would still give people the option to ""opt out"": when they see they need to pay a fee on incoming deposits, they can always take the seed and get their money back. What I propose is basically adding a ""flag"" to txo\'s in the wallet once the fee is paid. The flag carries over to the change stemming from the deposits for which the fee is paid. \n\nBut please, don\'t use the 3rd output system. '"

27,"b'As a webshop that wants to start accepting XMR, what are things we should know? (Few question inside! :) )'",17,"b""This is entirely dependant on how you go about setting up monero with your shop. There are 2 easy providers for this: https://globee.com and http://monerointegrations.com \n\nGlobee has its own nodes running to verify transactions and acts as a middle man for you, they handle the wallets, nodes, everything. You have to trust them.\n\n If you prefer to go the trust-less route you can choose Monero-Integrations. In that case you will need to download the monero command line tools from https://getmonero.org/downloads. You don't actually have to run your own node if you prefer to use a remote node, but you will have to create a view-only wallet and set it up with the monero-wallet-rpc. Some general instructions are in [the READMEs](https://github.com/monero-integrations/monerowp/blob/master/README.md). If you are running your monero-wallet-rpc on TAILS, you will probably have some problems. This is because your e-shop needs to be able to connect to that wallet-rpc which means you will have to setup your TAILS drive as a server and if your e-shop is over clearnet you will also come up with issues because TAILS is ofc on TOR. If your site is over clearnet, I highly recommend choosing a different OS. That way it will be as simple as setting up the wallet-rpc on that drive and opening up the appropriate port.\n\n I work with /u/serhack on the Monero-Integrations project and I would say that the #1 difference between Monero and Bitcoin in this aspect is the way you verify that transactions have been sent. With Bitcoin you can just watch the address on the transparent blockchain and see that a tx was made. With monero you have to setup a wallet with a viewkey and check each block for a tx made to you with the appropriate payment id. This is why you need to setup your wallet-rpc with a view-only wallet for tools like Monero-Integrations or Kasisto  """

11,b'Only 3 coins will survive in the long run',11,"b'I like that it gives Monero a positive light, but over all: stupid article.\n \nBitcoin is no better store of value than Monero (and potentially worse) - the main arguement that bitcoin is a good store of value is because it is a simple, bare bones and long lasting cryptocurrency that rarely changes; but this simply isn\'t true. It is actively under going how you transact with it, and it\'s fees have skyrocketed. I know it hasn\'t changed much technologically, but that doesn\'t matter. That\'s one facet of change. Lightening network and higher fees is a huge alteration in how it is used. \n\nAs for decred, ""voting"" doesn\'t stop forks. You can still fork decred and votes don\'t stop that from happening at all. I\'d also argue that a community voting isn\'t likely representative of who uses it, but rather who holds the most. How does it stop sybil attacks if it isn\'t just who holds the most? Why would those holding the most have in mind the best interests of the community? Perhaps they just want the price to go higher and higher. \n\nTheir claim with Monero: ""Most likely, it will be used primarily for transactions and not to store value or make everyday purchases.""   \n\nFucking why?   Who writes an educational article but then doesn\'t elaborate on the claims they make. Ridiculous. \n\nThey don\'t ever elaborate on that, despite the fact that, like decred, Monero too will be getting the lightening network and other scaling solutions (as will all coins) but that it\'s more scarce than bitcoin (until 2040) with a higher utility than Bitcoin. It can do almost everything as bitcoin (timelock transactions aren\'t the same) and more.  \n\nNow, there are some arguments against Monero as being a fantastic store of value; mostly that it is an actively developed cryptocurrency, but a fungible, private, anonymous store of value clearly has more utility than one that isn\'t. Swiss and Cayman island type banks exist for a reason. \n'"

11,b'Only 3 coins will survive in the long run',0,"b'With all due respect to the author, *again* with this horseshit about Bitcoin BTC being ""just a store of value"". It was always designed to be a currency, used for transactions, big and small. Its ability to be a store of value is wholly dependent on its ability to be a currency first. \n\nThe reason it\'s slow now is *because it has been intentionally broken*. There is no virtue in sucking out loud. It\'s fixable, and Blockstream don\'t wanna, because they wanna sell their proprietary side channels. That\'s why BCH was created in the first place, and that\'s the legitimate successor to the Bitcoin name and legacy. At the point of the split, after all, two identical Bitcoins existed, bit-perfect. They were both forks from the original. BCH didn\'t bud off the side - the original was divided into two. Then they both made changes. \n\nFurthermore, this obsession with the Lightning Network is also horseshit, just like the entire Lightning Network. It won\'t work to speed Bitcoin up, and it won\'t work for Decred either. Decred is a nutty choice anyway for a third survivor coin. \n\nAs for Monero, yes, it certainly makes a strong case with bulletproof anonymity. Cash needs to be untraceable. It has been untraceable for millennia and only in the latter decades has this system of control, as Andreas Antonopolous calls it, sprung into being. The overbearing control of the citizens is not worth the hysteria over money laundering etc that now exists. \n\nIt\'s entirely probable that many coins will vanish just because they have no unique use case or purpose, but to cut it down to three is nonsense. \n\nLooking at one of my favorite projects right now, Substratum, the SUB token has unique utility in the system and therefore has a niche it will retain as long as the service exists. The same is true for many coins. They will never be used as a general purpose ""buying groceries"" currency, but that doesn\'t mean they\'ll die off. \n\nETH is also not a general purpose currency, not really. It\'s not intended to be used as a day to day currency. \n\nIt\'s possible that we\'ll wind up with just a few general purpose currencies, that I\'ll grant, but to say that only three blockchain-based cryptos will exist is simply idiotic.\n'"
5,b'Is it possible for Monero to implement useful proof-of-work like Primecoin?',3,"b'Finding a useful proof of work algorithm is inevitably more complex than finding prime numbers. There are always more primes, but the process of finding primes diverges into many different processes (ie. there are many ways to find prime numbers). So it is not verifiably true to say ""O(n) can never be equal to 1!"". There could exist a case where O(n)=1 and finding primes becomes trivial. With proof of work, you care exclusively about the process and the truth of it; therein lies the usefulness of pow. Finding primes is potentially dangerous cryptographically.

9,b'What do you all think about Buffett saying cryptos wont end well?',7,"b""Well the important thing here is that Warren invests in things that he knows very well.  He is a disciple of Benjamin Graham, who advocated that if you can't understand everything about a business or company, then you should not invest.  But those were very different times, as the investment packages were very limited/basic back then.\n\nNow we have all kinds of investment options and here rolls up bitcoin.  I think it's still VERY important that people understand the purpose of bitcoin and it's technology, but I also think he's right in that it's still new and it's trying to find it's identity.  I mean, It's supposed to be a currency, but most people are buying it up and treating it as a commodity, for example.  Most people don't even understand HOW it gets it's value.  And that is the problem.\n\nI'm not saying that Bitcoin is bound to fail (the technology behind it is very secure!), but it lacks direction.  And this is where other alt-coins have kinda tried to take over, and they are all trying to have their own identity.\n\nBut what is important is that, even if your into bitcoin or not, you can still make money even if your wrong about an investment simply by investing in what you know."""

A lot of coins seem to have been put out there just to make money on this shit wave we are riding at the moment. To be honest, I think bitcoin is the biggest turd in the toilet now that its privacy has been cracked.\n\nThe only reason bitcoin soared like it did was because of its privacy. People wanting to traded in things their governments didn't approve of wanted a way to shift massive amounts of money from point a to point b in an untraceable manner. That is unraveling now and that along with the early tech underlying the coin will probably lead to its demise.\n\nOn the other hand, this bitcoin private fork coming might have a future with that type of folk in mind. As well as anyone who would rather their barter be between A & B and government can C its fucking way out of the gathering. I get that. I feel that way to about a lot of things. People roasted McAfee for buying whores, drugs, and porn with his coins.......not my business.....not YOUR's either. And it sure as hell ain't some government who established laws that few if any of us were ever consulted in the crafting of either. \n\nJust in the USA, we are spending at least 90 billion a year to cage people for engaging in the drug trade. Now I understand there is some violence in that trade but that violence would not have been there had the USA's laws not created a big goddamn black market that should have never happened and would not have happened had the free market been allowed to do what it does best....hook A but with B for a price. The violence in drugs is the fault of the government for regulation the people should have never allowed.\n\nOff my soapbox and rant there (disclosure: I do not use drugs nor am I particularly supportive of druggies but it their choice, not mine or from my opinion, my government's right to prevent them from consuming drugs if they want to.)\n\nHaving a real use is what will make a coin have a long term viability. If its use is only to facilitate transactions that the powers that be frown upon then the end of that coin will come sooner or later. Nation States frown upon those who would call them pertaining to their authority to regulate from birth till death.\n\nEther probably has a good future. Its smart contracts are a killer feature even if there are other options out there now. I still don't totally understand it but I do know it has a place in the future of contracts and using blockchain for verification purposes. I can think of at least one trillion dollar idea for ether right now and I'm HODLing close to my heart until I figure out what to do with that idea.\n\nThe key here is you have to have a purpose or eventually HYPE is going to end and you will die.

However, the rate technological developments look kinda promising when compared to the rate of adoption. lol\n\nNormally I don't share my more extreme thoughts, especially when they get all Ray kurzweil dystopian, and can't really be debunked in the present... but I'm gonna:\n\nThe next release of Monero will have both multisig and subaddresses. Supposedly it will also be on coinbase soon, which has 12 million users.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means 12 million people will be able to login to coinbase, buy Monero, and send that from their coinbase account to a darknet market without fear of being tracked, or fear of being scammed, and without fear that coinbase will shut down your account.\n\nNo one will see how much was sent, who sent it or recieved it, or even when it was sent.\n\nThink the government is going to be cool with that? I don't.\n\nIt's going to provoke cryptocurrency regulations, and narratives about funding terrorism, the war on drugs, and all those other scare tactics they use.\n\nBtcoin and other blockchains with a public ledger (literally all of them) are going to be hit in the cross fire.\nThey aren't ready for it. People invested in public blockchains have a less dystopian view of government behavior, and it's inaccurate.\n\nThe regulations will further push people into Monero or out of cryptocurrency entirely. The regulations will only increase Monero's utility and price by broad sweeping regulations on cryptocurrency, and act as a bigger point of contention for cryptocurrency communities: stay legal but not have fungiblity, a fundamental aspect of money/value transfer and have the users be tracked almost entirely, or risk regulatory issues by providing privacy, fungiblity and real utility to the users.\nEveryone but the Cypherpunks and Cryptoanarchists will slowly leave the scene.\n\nBitcoin is like a grayish colored duck of some sort. It got people talking and thinking.\nMonero is the black swan, lurking in the shadows, ready to do whatever that black swan wants to do.\n\nTo think a government would just allow competing currencies to exist: currencies that jeaprodize every aspect of their power and existence is absurd and wrong. Governments mindlessly go after Marijuana which poses zero threat to them or anyone else. They will absolutely go after cryptocurrencies.\nEveryone in the early stages of bitcoin operated under the assumption that draconian regulations might occur and it could all be made illegal: other attempted currencies, before it was discovered how to make them decentralized, were always outlawed. People went to prison for operating a ledger, a balance sheet.\n\nThis fear got diluted and nearly went away, and the government has been legitimizing cryptocurrencies lately by allowing for exchanges, ETF funds, you name it - but guess what? The government isn't a cohesive mass with specific goals it wants to achieve. It doesn't have real foresight or take preventative measures.\n\nIt's a composite of people, all of which are self interested and rational and trying to keep their job and make themselves more important, have a higher income and better job security.\n\nThe IRS, DEA, CIA FBI, FCC, SEC, FTC, NSA, - you name it. They all benefit from regulating cryptocurrencies. They will push laws that give them more oversight and they will pass with little resistance.\n\nI think cryptocurrencies will have a hugely positive impact on humanity, but that doesn't matter. It doesn't give job security to the DEA or any other part of the government. Regulating them and upping he war on drugs does, however.\n\nThey'll try to squash it out soon, but not every government will act in unison, and some will see it as an opportunity to make a lot of additional money and get more capital into their country. Switzerland may long facilitate it like it does its Swiss banks. Cayman Islands and other offshore banks will likely jump on the opportunity.\n\nThis will make for a wonky environment, but eventually something will happen: a government will under go hyperinflation and as it fails, cryptocurrency will step in. Governments that form from the change will be weak and unable to effectively print their own money. It will be the people's money at that point.\nThis will happen again, and again at an accelerating rate. Eventually all government backed fiat currencies will be replaced.\n\nTaxation will regress to what it was in the mideival times, but we'll be living in a technologically advanced world. Roads and other items subject to tragedy of the commons and free rider issues will be addressed by Dominant Assurance Contracts and privatization.\n\nIt'll be a slow process for all of this to happen, but it's going to happen, and you should watch for the signs. Maybe act accordingly when it starts to really go down. A half trillion dollar marketcap in cryptocurrencies 9 years after their first creation is the beginning of it.\nA properly fungible, private currency is another. Soon, with tech perhaps like SPECTRE will provide insane scalability that can bring this tech to the masses.\n\nThis is the stuff talked about by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman and iconic Cryptoanarchist Timothy C. May.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/errI-bKEKEQ\n\nhttps://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html\n\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/ (ignore the bitcoin maximalists narrative, it's wrong.

If you can't find that either, then look for a person who doesn't mind if his/her savings all of a sudden drop to zero because their money is suddenly considered tainted due to a recent arrest that connects them to a crime that happened 5 years ago by people they have never heard of.\n\nNobody likes to lose money. Nobody likes strangers examining their personal finances. Its not that people don't care, its that many don't understand. Those that are slow to wake up will learn the painful way. Everybody needs privacy."""
11,b'Adoption as censorship protection',3,"b'> What I mean is that if only a very small group of people uses Monero, then the authorities would target that group as suspicious and might want to monitor them more closely. They would still not be able to track their payments in Monero, but the users will somehow be subject to scrutiny.\n\nThere really isn\'t anything that can be done to stop that except for the individual to take steps to properly anonymize and secure their privacy.\n\n> I personally think that people is only going to use Monero if it\'s easy and cheap to use, because most people don\'t really care about privacy.\n\nThat\'s fine.  If they don\'t care about privacy there are plenty of other cryptos out there that focus on ease of use and fast, low cost, transactions.  Monero isn\'t being developed for them (IMO).  That may sound harsh, but it\'s true.  Monero is a currency designed to be secure, private and untraceable.  The stated mission on getmonero.org doesn\'t say that Monero is a currency designed to be easy and cheap.\n\n> Am I talking nonsense or do you guys agree with that assesment?\n\nJust because I disagree with your position and statements doesn\'t mean I think you are talking nonsense.  To me, it\'s great to see folks questioning things... even if it\'s not an uncommon question around here... if Nicolas van Saberhagen hadn\'t questioned how Bitcoin does it\'s thing, then cryptonote wouldn\'t have happened and neither would have Monero.\n\nTo sum up my personal take on it.  They, the devs and the community, are building it and folks are coming.  (heh, sex joke)  The strong focus on the technology, both by the community and core devs, means that Monero is being built to be a strong, secure and usable currency.  It is the focus on the long term game that will draw folks to Monero, even if it means they are drawn to it more slowly.  I\'m going to be slightly narcissistic here when I say a comment I made in another, similar, thread sums it up nicely.  ""Lets focus on making sure Monero has a strong foundation to launch from before trying to aim this rocket at the moon.""'"

11,b'Adoption as censorship protection',2,"b""Tor has this problem as well. It's hard to know what you do over Tor, but easy to know that you do use Tor. You can then be singled out for further scrutiny. There was some dumbass who sent a bomb threat via email to his university (UMass IIRC) through Tor but was discovered because he was the only Tor user on the campus network at that time. Pretty easy to put 2 and 2 together. \n\nUsing privacy enhancing technology is still a good thing to do though. No reason for everything you do to be public, and if someone wants to track you, you might as well make them work for it. """
11,b'Adoption as censorship protection',2,"b'> With this in mind, scaling and getting on with adoption is really important if Monero is to be successful, am I wrong?\n\nIt is a good point. De-anonymising who is behind running monero endpoints could reveal a lot of information. While, if Monero was like https, and ubiquitous, then identifying specific users via ports/packet analysis is useless, since everyone is a user. \n\nConsequently, there is an incentive for those who value privacy and anonymity to subsidize wider adoption to others who do not value those features as highly.'"
11,b'Adoption as censorship protection',2,"b""I wouldn't say people dont completely care about privacy. We all have secrets and not all secrets are bad. We all have personal life's and for the most part don't go sharing every personal detail with a random person. We live in a world where if you don't take the necessary precautions the government will be able to obtain your personal secrets, which might also reveal another person's secrets too. You and me can both be texting about something personal but all it takes is one wrong move to reveal it all. \n\nI think the toughest roadblock we have in the future in regards to adoption, is getting people to understand that privacy isn't just for criminals. Privacy is one of those things people will realize is actually really important, but only when they realize that it is all gone"""

The people who have come this far into the crypto-currency world are the people who have a genuine interest in these things. But we aren't the only fish in the sea. We need more people to understand how these things work so that they can understand why ETN is a better coin. Hell, some of the people here are ONLY here because they read on some article that ETN was going to skyrocket in value in the next coming year. However true this may be, it really shows a level of immaturity within our community, and the crypto-community. We need to get rid of this stigma that crypto-currencies are for delusional people, looking to invest $1 and hoping they will pull out $100,000.

Basically over the last 2 days it's paid out less than a third of the expected amount verses what I can earn at nanopool.

It is consistently bad!""",2,"b'*I\'m going to reply to the main post, cause I don\'t want anyone to think that I\'m replying to them cause I think they are wrong* \n\nIt\'s the pool\'s effort, true measure of luck would be to take a sample of blocks of effort and calculate how much overall effort was used.  You would then compare that to other pools.\n\nKeep in mind that just because one pool is having problems, doesn\'t mean that all others are doing better. For example, just because this pool\'s effort went up, doesn\'t mean that, another pools effort went down - that other pool could have problems too.  \n\nAdditionally, luck is not based on a measure of time, but rather a measure of *n* blocks.  While time is helpful, the true test of luck is to compare across similar sample sizes, rather than time values.  This helps us determine things like, ""Would I rather join a pool that is 80% lucky doing 50 blocks an hour paying 1 btc per block or would I rather join a pool that is 50% lucky doing 100 blocks an hour paying 0.8 btc per block"".  Just eyeballing it isn\'t going to cut it...\n\nThe nature of luck: In a perfect world, the amount of effort any pool should put in to solving a block should be as close to 100% as possible (In an ideal world you obviously want a pool with the lowest effort possible).  Some pools are less and some are more.  To achieve 100%, you will mine some lucky blocks (under 100% effort) and some unlucky blocks (over 100% effort).  Because of maths, the amount of time spent mining under 100% is overshadowed by the time spent mining over 100% - it\'s estimated that for every lucky block, you will have 3 unlucky blocks.  That\'s the nature of luck.  Think of it this way: If the pools average block time is 2 minutes, and you mine a block in 2 seconds (lucky!), then you can expect that, to meet the average pool time, the next 3 blocks will have to be at least just under 8 minutes.  This isn\'t a hard set rule, you can always mine the next block lucky, but eventually you\'ll have to meet that average (or drive it down to a new low).  So when you see lots of high effort, don\'t panic - that\'s just luck catching up to you.  Every pool goes thru it.\n\nAlso, most pools are using PPLNS. Because the nature of PPLNS, poolhopping decreases your own luck.  PPLNS pays you for previous shares you\'ve submitted.  People who stay on the server and people who are casual and just login to mine whenever, aren\'t really affected, but those who chase luck are highly affected by it.  The reason is simple: In a PPLNS system, you are given credit based on the last number of *n* shares submitted (based on the settings of your pool).  In the event that your pool is lucky, the last *n* shares could be the shares *you submitted from the previous block (EDIT: If this isn\'t clear, the key take away is that your shares can be counted twice)*.  So regardless if the previous block was lucky or unlucky, you get credit.  People who are pool hopping to chase luck will lose because they were never there to begin with, and you cannot predict luck - the pool they hopped to can suddenly encounter effort increase or payout decrease (do to hoppers).\n\nSo the big takeaway from this is, this screenshot tells you very little.  I see a lot of effort, and one orphan, but I also see a single digit effort (wow!) and this is from a slice of less than one day.  Usually luck is measured in 1k or 10k block sizes.  You don\'t know anything about how many users, payout, pool type, average block time, etc etc. (but lets be real, this is spacepools - but if this was another pool for example...).  **The biggest issue here is that there is some kind of communication that there is a problem here, and there is none - that is the nature of luck and that all pools experience it and it is perfectly normal.  There is no TLDR.**\n\nI see a lot of people make snap decisions and jump to *that other pool* and then realize it has a difficulty of *way too much* and a minimum payout of *omg its going to take me 3 months to get that much* and now *guess i\'m stuck on this pool for, like, forever now if i want my coins*.  Don\'t be a pool hopper, play smart.'"

Our OpenVPN servers are configured with \xe2\x80\x9cverb 0\xe2\x80\x9d so that they keep no logs at all. Our SOCKS Proxy servers do keep authentication logs which include the IP address, but these logs are cleared every 6 hours. We have a session management system that tracks which users are logged into which servers, however that system operates on real-time data and does not log events.\n\n2. What The * Services, LLC is incorporated in the USA.\n\n3. We use Google Analytics on our website for visitors.\n\n4. We respond saying that we are a VPS/VPN provider and that we do not have the logs requested nor any other logs about our customers usage of our service.\n\n5. We have not yet received such a court order or subpoena for user information. However, if we do in the future, we will take several steps. First, we would consult with our lawyers to confirm the validity of the order/subpoena, and respond accordingly if it is NOT a valid order/subpoena. Then we would alert our user of the event if we are legally able to.\n\nIf the order/subpoena is valid, we would see if we have the ability to provide the information requested, and respond accordingly we do NOT have the information requested. If we DO have the information requested, we would immediately reconfigure our systems to stop keeping that information. Then we would consult with our lawyer to determine if there is anyway we can fight the order/subpoena and/or what is the minimum level of compliance we must meet.\n\n6. BitTorrent and other file-sharing traffic is allowed on all VPN/Proxy servers which are NOT located in the USA.\n\n7. Our payment options include PayPal, Bit-Pay (bitcoin), PerfectMoney, and Coinbase (bitcoin). When a user selects a payment method our system will remember that payment method and link it to their account. For this reason, we suggest that our users do not put in their real name & contact information, and that they should pay us anonymously via Bitcoin.\n\n8. All of our OpenVPN and SOCKS Proxy servers are running OpenBSD and are using LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL. This protects our servers from a wide range of attacks on the encryption.\n\nOur OpenVPN Servers use AES-256-CBC & SHA512 HMAC for the Data Channel, and DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 on the Control Channel. Our OpenVPN Servers are also configured with 4096bit RSA keys and a custom 4096bit Diffie-Hellman parameters. Our SOCKS Proxy is based on OpenSSH, so they support any ciphers the client wants to use. With OpenSSH, the Client decides what cipher to use instead of the Server.\n\nWe push routes to our OpenVPN Clients which instruct them to route all IP traffic which is not destined for their local network to be routed through the VPN. This includes DNS traffic. We push OpenVPN Client configuration files which include \xe2\x80\x9cresolv-retry infinite\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperstist-tun\xe2\x80\x9d, which when combined should prevent the Client from sending traffic in-the-clear unless the user manually kills the OpenVPN connection.\n\nFurthermore, all of our OpenVPN and SOCKS Proxy servers are full IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack and we push a default route for both IPv4 and IPv6 to our clients. This is critical because if your home ISP gives you an IPv6 address, your computer will use IPv6 instead of IPv4. You will leak a significant amount of traffic if we did not push you a default route for IPv6.\n\n9. We do not offer DNS leak protection via kill switches.\n\n10. We do not offer a custom VPN application. Instead, we instruct our users to install an OpenVPN client of their choice from a trusted source i.e. openvpn.net.\n\n11. All of our infrastructure is hosted in 3rd party colocations. However, we use full-disk-encryption on all of our servers.\n\n12. We have servers in the USA, Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden. '"

4,b'Since BTC is basically the Catalyst of Crypto - Thoughts on this?',1,"b""USD is no longer based on the value of gold, it hasn't been for years.  It's based on the faith that the US government will not falter on its debts, as well as the fact that it's a currency that is widely accepted by businesses and can easily be used for everyday purchases.  Take away either of those two things, and the faith in USD will go down and it plummet in value.\n\nLikewise, BTC's value is based on faith and the associated cost to maintain the blockchain.  The problem is that you can easily argue that BTC is neither convent to purchase everyday items nor widely accepted by businesses (the fees are just too much).  Instead, BTC is being treated as a commodity, being traded back and forth like gold.   It fails as a 'currency'.\n\nForex Markets exist, yes - but unless there is something that drives the value of the underlying currency, then you'd just be trading paper.\n\nSo, from the eyes of traditional investors, *where does BTC get it's value?* BTC lacks direction, something other altcoins are keen on fixing.  BTC's fees are way too high, something other altcoins are also fixing.  Transaction times are too high, something other altcoins are fixing, and the list goes on.  But the biggest obstacle is getting the currency widely used.\n\nOther than that, any value that you assign to a currency is just a bubble - It's faith, but it can easily be broken.\n\nEdit: I should note that - I believe in the value of cryptocurrencies. But I also think, based on the fact that I can't just walk into any store and use them, or go online to my favorite stores and use them, the value they are given isn't their true value.  We are most likely in a bubble.  Whether that is a good thing or not is up to you.  My advice, that I give to any person entering cryptocurrencies, is that you have lost all your money."""

148,b'You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use XWallet if you care about your privacy',22,"b'This is kind of sad all around. \n\nTo the Monero community: it\'s not quite so easy as just switching a fee structure on a whim. If the business owner did their due diligence, they\'ve planned their entire revenue stream (including hiring, development, support, etc.) on the original fee structure. Now that the work is all done, it would take a lot of replanning. Not quite as simple as it may seem (most people here have probably never run a business). As well, ""just recode"" the fee structure. Again, not that simple. Takes time (which equals money).\n\nAs well, if there is something in the protocol that has a potential to be exploited, you must count on it being exploited. This isn\'t the fault of the xwallet dev. That feature needs to go. You MUST assume that people will break things, either maliciously or not, and it\'s unacceptable to blame a user or business for using something built into the protocol in a way ""not intended"". Where was the MRL bulletin about recommendations on using this command? If it existed, at least we\'d have something to point to and say ""you shoulda looked at this"". If we don\'t have it, why are we yelling at this guy?\n\nTo the xwallet dev, I\'m sorry, but a lot of this (including your current frustration) is on you, though I sympathize with you greatly. It\'s been stated in this thread) and I\'ve seen it over the weeks, that people have asked you about this very thing throughout several updates. I find it highly unlikely that you didn\'t see any of those questions or concerns. From the get go, you probably should have brought this to MRL as part of doing your due diligence if you keep claiming you want to help Monero (which I believe you do). The fact that you didn\'t is on you. \n\nIt seems you wanted to ignore it, launch, and have people be ok with it. From the perspective of the writer of the article, these questions were asked again and again with no response. Now, on the eve of launch, they felt like they have to warn the community as there\'s been nothing but radio silence on your end. And it worked. This blew up in such a way that it forced your hand to respond for the first time (not very professionally might I add, but I empathize). Still, your lack of communication is on you. \n\nI really wish it didn\'t turn out like this. There were many opportunities for all this to be avoided, but none of them were taken. That, coupled with Monero being a jumpy ""no nonsense"" community equals current situation. You can blame the protocol (with some valid points, indeed, I will push to get this changed at a protocol level), you can blame the community, or we can work together to make this still work. :)\n\nRemember, we\'re all imperfect people. Let\'s have grace, let\'s work with each other. This is not unsalvageable. We\'re all on the same team here. \n\nEdit: just tagging u/xmr-rusticbison.'"

Just make it a paid app. Goodness gracious. '"
148,b'You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use XWallet if you care about your privacy',25,"b'Thanks so much for bringing this up. \n\nThe is a classic example of why trying to enforce monetization in software is an absolutely terrible idea. The problem is that more often not the process of enforced monetization turns the software into junk or as in this case worse than junk. It is not the 0.0005 XMR per transaction ""wallet fee"" but the cost which this imposes which just for starters is several orders of magnitude higher. A current fee for a 2 output Monero transaction with the current default is ~0.011 XMR. Turn a 2 output transaction into a 3 output transaction and the fee increases by about 0.005 XMR or 10x the ""wallet fee"". I addition there is very much the potential for an attack here. I have not at this point fully analysed the full privacy implications of this attack but the post does provide evidence that of the potential seriousness especially given Apple\'s market share. \n\nI now come to the alternatives. The first idea pay in blocks of 20 transactions is only slightly less ludicrous the original idea since now we are paying a a 0.011 XMR fee on a 0.010 XMR transaction. This is quite apart from the fact a centralized ledger will be needed to keep track of all of these fees and this will also have privacy implications. The third option is in reality a variant of the second with the same implications A part from the privacy and network bloeat this creates all the payments in XMR option are very likely in contravention of Apple\'s terms of service, since Apple would not get its 30%. The latter is the entire point of Apple\'s DRM infected walled garden. \n\nThe last alternative is to charge for the app via the Apple app store either on a download basis or on a subscription bases. First of all Apple\'s charge of 30% is way lower than the cost the above mess will cost the Monero blockchain. The Monero blockchain will pass on these costs to the developers and users of this wallet. The big argument is ideological. One the surface this kinda makes sense, but in reality it does not. If one is opposed to Apple\'s business model, and believe me on this I am a hawk, then one simply stays well away from Apple and its DRM infected walled garden. Even better one looks at every opportunity to profit from the herd mentality of the isheep. For example: Buy Bitcoin in 2011 - 2012, wait for Apple to give the isheep permission to own Bitcoin in 2014. Sell the Bitcoin at a 5000%  - 10000% mark-up and use the proceeds to buy Monero. The case in this situation to use the Apple store to monetize the wallet is actually very simple. The users have already paid a very steep price, by staying in Apple\'s DRM infected walled garden to in order allow the app developers to monetize the app. So it makes very little sense to have them pay yet again on the Monero blockchain.

A 2-output tx is 13 kb and (assuming default transaction priority) would pay 0.003120 XMR in fees, a 3-output tx is 19 kb and would pay 0.004560 with 0.0005 XMR to the X Wallet team for 0.005060 XMR total in fees.\n\nSo, to pay X Wallet team 0.0005 XMR would cost me an exta 0.00144 XMR in fees due to the larger transaction, or an extra $0.46 per tx just to pay them $0.16 per tx, assuming they use default transaction priority. If they use low priority (which they definitely should given that blocks are hardly ever full) then the transaction fees will be 1/4 of whatever I've listed above. Still not great to spend ~$0.12 extra on fees just to send them $0.16 though."""

I also have absolutely no issue with paying for the use of a quality product (can\'t even estimate anymore how much I donated to all kinds of FFS proposals), but not at the detriment of everyone\'s privacy. That would be a Trojan horse, which we as a community should not condone from the start.\n\nPersonally, I like the credit system, where you buy e.g. 20 transaction credits for 0.01 XMR or so, and you can top-up when you run out of them.\n\n**Note to moderators**: could you please remove the ""X Wallet \xe2\x80\x93 Coming Soon!"" entry in the Mobile Wallets section of this subreddit? Unless the community has verified it doesn\'t harm our ecosystem, we should not give it any kind of credit or endorsement.

148,b'You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use XWallet if you care about your privacy',7,"b""Using this fee model definitely weakens Monero's privacy. But from my understanding, your graphs over simplify Monero transaction processes to make this situation look really bad? If Monero transactions are like your graphs, Monero itself will be broken easily. \n\nSince Monero is using stealth addresses, you can not simply find links between two addresses or transactions. Meaning even all the X wallet users are generating 3 outputs transactions, you can only find out there is a high probability that a certain amount of transactions are from X wallet users but you still can not find the links between these transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, X wallet's fee model definitely weakens Monero's privacy. Since now the transactions from X wallet might be excluded out. Meaning there is a much smaller pool of transactions to obscure each each. And there might be a higher probability to find something with data analysis. """

This is 100 % due to the fact that Poloniex allows margin. I often see price manipulation through order sizes larger than the entire order book on bitfinex because of margin, though I never have seen one this stupid, and obvious in its attempt to manipulate price. Poloniex obviously does not have margin controls in place, so if someone has 150 000 BTC equivalent in cash or other crypto they can pledge it as collateral and initiate a short position up to 2.5 x in leverage. This is classic market manipulation by the biggest manipulators in the crypto game. Poloniex should find out who that rich list account is that is spoofing the market with sell orders larger than the entire outstanding supply of a coin and restrict this type of activity. A 325 000 BTC sell order on LTC, that is worth $3.575 billion USD at BTC $11 000 price. This is impossible and would be larger than the entire 24 hr avg volume of LTC. I bet it is bitfinex or another market manipulator. There is evidence compiled that Bitfinex owns the rich list accounts on many exchanges and uses TETHER to manipulate prices. Bitfinex deposits TETHER in mass on Poloniex and they keep as little TETHER as possible at Bitfinex. They deposit the TETHER at other exchanges buy up raw coins no leverage and take out the raw physical. I am not saying 100 percent that is them though, I truly have no idea but it is easy to see that it is a rich list account attempting market manipulation, by suppressing prices during the crash of BTC on the 16 to 17th.\n>\n> \\- Cryptogenesis\n\nI know Bitfinnex is doing some sketchy things with Tether, but I hadn't thought about that theory before."""

This wallet really needs to allow end users to specify a starting height to speed things up.  Also, are there details about where associated wallet files are stored on iOS devices since the source code is not open?\n\nAdditionally, this wallet needs to allow the IP addresses, ports, usernames, and passwords for connecting to more than one Monero full node and stored for easy selection, like **Monerujo**.  Lastly, production releases of **Cake Wallet** need to have the executable prevent **screen mirroring** as a counter measure for screen scraping to steal Electrum wallet seed words when viewed.  **Monerujo** does this.'"

(For the user, because for you it still means a lot of additional work, unfortunately.)\n\nThe notification about pending transaction should also show its age.\n\nKnowing that blocks are mined every 2 minutes on average, you could also [poll the daemon to check the mempool size](https://getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/daemon-rpc.html#get_transaction_pool) and estimate the mining time.\n\nIt would be also good to push for review and changes in the daemon code:\n\n* Check if in the [scenario of the attack](https://github.com/amiuhle/kasisto/issues/31) mining one of the transactions makes daemon purge the other from the mempool. I see no reason to hold a confirmed double spend in the pool.\n* Make sure the daemon rejects obviously invalid transactions.

28,b'Why i have not invested in Electroneum yet.',25,"b'Simple core questions all potential investors need to ask in relation to investing in ETN or any crypto:\n\nIs ETN a currency as of today? No. \n\nIs acquiring ETN practical as of today? No, though this can change by being added  to exchanges that have direct Fiat to Crypto conversion (looking at Coinbase for US traders/Investors)\n\nDoes ETN show promise?  Yes, via two avenues (these are my personal opinions and do not represent the sentiment of the masses)\n\n1. Through its market penetration strategy of deploying ETN via simulated mining to millions of mobile device owners across the world.\n2. Partnerships with mobile carriers and large client base companies to carry ETN as a method of payment for products and services.\n\nIn all things due diligence is key!\n'"
28,b'Why i have not invested in Electroneum yet.',12,"b""These are all valid questions that an astute person would ask themselves. \n\n1st: ETN has not found its footing as a currency yet. Much like paper money in its early acceptance, it will take time. What ETN does have on its side to assist in its development as a currency is a very hard working Dev team that is focused very much on brand recognition and implementation as well as a steadfast community that is waiting for its time to pounce, which will be as soon as the mobile miner is released. \n\n2nd: It is true that ETN has not been able to fulfill many of the initial goals that had been listed in the white paper. Much of this has been due to the unprecedented interest in the coin itself and what it is aiming to do. While these speed bumps may be aggravating the team has done a great job at taking a step back and reevaluating what caused those issues in the first place and are working diligently to remedy them. First of which was security concerns. They brought HackerOne in to asses their vulnerability and were given the all clear. Our current 2 big issues is the slow speed of the online wallet and the fact that the mobile miner (arguably the most important part of this coin) is not out yet. We know they are working on the scaling issues of the wallet which will increase speed. The last thing we need to do is start the Mobile Miner without this issue being remedied first as it will only add to the headache.\n\n3rd: Crytpo has come a long way since the days of The Silk Road and has gained a lot of traction in the public due in large part to the media constantly talking about it. Interest is at an all time high, the greatest barrier to entry is that people are confused about what crypto currency is, they are afraid because it is volatile, and they don't know how to obtain any. ETN looks to Educate, be easy to obtain (especially in under developed countries) and is openly stating that they are working to make a stable coin, which once again, ETN has been surprisingly stable for the short time it has been around.\n\nNow, take all that for what it is worth, everything could change tomorrow, but as of right now ETN seems to me to be one of the smartest bets you can hedge.  \n\n\nEdit: Formating\n"""
28,b'Why i have not invested in Electroneum yet.',10,b'Wow guys really good discussion here some great thoughts thanks for sharing to the community !'
28,b'Why i have not invested in Electroneum yet.',5,"b""Very legit questions. \n\nI am by no means an expert and probably just as new as you are. Your questions are good questions, that I think everyone has. Crypto is a new space and quite frankly almost impossible to predict. Basically all coins are based on speculation and hype, and there aren't any real uses for any coin yet. (With the exception here and there) \n\nI don't think you will find the answers you want, it's always a gamble. I think you just need to go by your gut feeling, that's what I did. Something about ETN immediately pulled me towards the coin, and it just felt right. I missed the ICO, but managed to buy my coins on Cryptopia around the beginning of November, so still relatively cheap. \n\nWIth all it's ups and downs, iI still feel like ETN is a good investment, and have a very solid transparent team behind it. They could communicate a little better here and there, and I do wish they had a clear roadmap. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, go by your feelings. If it feels like a good investment, then invest. If you feel like it's too risky, then invest in something else. The scary part is, waiting for a more clear future comes with a price, and that price is a higher price. Any huge announcement can double the price instantly and you will feel like you missed out on an opportunity.\n\nGood luck with whatever you do mate."""
28,b'Why i have not invested in Electroneum yet.',4,"b""I like this! Let's take it up a notch and try to understand why investors see bitcoin (and altcoins) as a bubble.\n\nYou might see investors throw around a term called 'intrinsic value' around.  Intrinsic value is something that if you were to strip away it's actual value, such as the value of it's assets, you'd be left with the value of things that would be left to make the business work, or tick, or 'the secret ingredient'.\n\nWhen it comes to things like currency, it's a bit more complex.  Years ago, the USD (I'm going on the basis of the US Gov) was based on the gold standard, so you could easily tie it's intrinsic value to that of gold.  Today, the intrinsic value is based on two things: The fact that the US Government won't default on it's debts, and that people believe (ie: faith) in the USD as a currency (and by extension can spend & use it).  If either of those two things are removed, the USD's intrinsic value falls and usefulness as a currency fails.\n\nIf you take the same concept to BTC (and other coins), you can easily see that, from the eyes of an investor, the intrinsic value of the currency is hard to identify.  This is why it is difficult to claim it has value.  Beyond what is needed to maintain the blockchain (power costs, hardware, fees, etc), the only thing left is the faith in the currency itself.\n\nExcept, that you can't just walk into a Wal-Mart and spend BTC, nor can you go online and spend BTC at your favorite store.  It's not easily spendable.  You have people looking at past history, and would choose rather to hold onto it, rather than spend it.  Fees are incredibly high, so it makes it inconvenient.  The list goes on.  BTC is not a currency...its a commodity.\n\nSure, you can invest in currencies like the Japanese Yen or the British Pound, but those have an entire market supporting them.  If those markets didn't exist, you'd be trading paper.  Cryptocurrencies aren't quite like trading paper, but it's not quite like trading traditional currencies either, something to be mindful of.\n\nThe whole take away here is that if your looking for any cryptocoin to mimic currencies, your not going to find it.  The technology is still very new.  BTC is being treated like a commodity.  There are still developments going on to fix issues to make transactions faster and fees lower.  One day, BTC (and other cryptocoins) will be actual currency, and can easily be spent anywhere anytime as easily as one would spend a dollar, but not today.\n\nSo right now, don't think of it as  investing in the currency, think of it as investing in the technology and the belief that it will work.  Whether you invest in the coins themselves or the companies, that is up to you."""

Don\'t get me wrong, the deposit of my LTC and purchase of the SafeX from it went smoothly enough. Back in Dec, a small group of customers were ""harassing"" their customer support over SafeX. Consequently, Cryptopia threw a fit and delisted SafeX with no warning. SafeX wallets were locked for around 10 days, and even after they unlocked wallets they are now charging 1500 SafeX tokens to withdraw, which seems very high. Because it is delisted, you cannot convert your SafeX into another alt, nor can you withdraw if you don\'t have enough SafeX to cover the fee. IMO, this exchange seems to be run by people with the maturity of children.\n\nHitBTC - I\'ve traded, PAY, VERGE, and Ripple here. This exchange is absolutely abysmal all around. Visit their subreddit for a full perspective. My experience was problems with withdrawals. Many wallets were locked for 2-3 weeks, citing maintenance. My first attempt at withdrawing XRP resulted in some strange failure; I submitted the withdrawal right before they locked the wallet. It took customer support 4 days to offer a canned reply to my ticket, and then another 6 days before my wallet was credited back with the XRP. Basically, support sucks there and their platform seems less than trustworthy. Again, this is purely my opinion. I have attempted to get all my tokens off their exchange and only have a bit of TETHER left to withdraw, which is in a locked wallet and cannot withdraw.\n\nI will never deal with either of these exchanges again.'"

People are expecting instant success, and it just isn\'t possible to achieve that overnight.  \n\nWhat\'s concerned me lately is what I\'ve been hearing about crackdowns on cryptos of which is what\'s been crippling the market.  The govt\'s didn\'t care about Bitcoin years ago...why?....because it wasn\'t successful.  Now that it\'s a real thing, you\'re seeing tax crackdowns and threats of banning with claims of ""unregulation"".  What concerns me, is how far can that go?  Just as ETN starts to really become successful one day, western govt\'s will outright ban it.  \n\nAnd actually.....cryptos aren\'t really a threat to central banks because it takes fiat currency to purchase cryptos anyhow.  If someone wants to go buy cryptos, they want to go obtain fiat of which the banks would like.  I believe it\'s WALL STREET that would lobby to have cryptos banned.  Because why invest in the stupid casino low return stock market, or have a low return savings account when one could go buy a digital storage of wealth and at least have a chance at getting a good return over time.\n\nCryptos basically show how old and outdated the ""stock market"" is.  If the stock market could operate like cryptocurrency...then instead of just being stuck with buying and selling only whole shares, why can\'t shares of stock divide down like cryptocurrency?  Why can\'t you just trade shares for shares without cashing out first?  Why can\'t you trade shares of stock into wallets elsewhere off of a trade account?  People view cryptos as a ""shady"" risky reclusive thing to get into and they still view the stock market as ""real investing"".  When in reality, cryptocurrency is still in it\'s pre-1992 internet era stages and the stock market is just nothing but an outdated casino system completely dominated and rigged by wall street of shares that are traded like marbles on an exchange in which has no tie to the corporation itself because the money you pay to buy a stock does not go towards the equity or cash holdings of a company nor do you get a return on profit unless the corporation wants to pay dividends, of which most do not these days.

13,b'Mimble Wimble! Not for me sorry',13,"b'I think I did ask some good questions regarding privacy. (https://np.reddit.com/r/Mimblewimble/comments/7dzm2y/monitor_transaction_relay_what_will_be_revealed/) Still need to get through some info and my hands dirty with the code a bit before I\'ll compile my thoughts on grin in an article.\n\n\nBut for now, these are my thoughts on Grin/MW:\n\n\n\n\n**Privacy Comparison of XMR and GRIN**:\n\n\n*i.e. Grin explained in terms of Monero - I know it\'s not accurate, more detailed explanation (as far as I understand) below the table.*\n\n\n\n | Monero | Grin\n :--------|:--------:|:--------:\nInputs | Ring Signatures | Coinjoin ^1 + nodes delete input info ^2\nOutputs | Dual key stealth addresses | ""spendkey only"" stealth addresses ^3\nAmounts | Hidden (CT) | Hidden (CT)\n\n\n ^1 : Coinjoin is optional on Grin. \n\n\n ^2 : Well, grin users hope that all nodes delete this info, but logging nodes are able to keep this info. \n\n\n ^3 : As far as I understand, there is only one key to spend the funds and no ""viewkey like"" functionality. This means that wallets need to be online simultaneously to be able to exchange data and receive the money. Compare it like this: if you lost your viewkey but still have your spendkey on monero, in theory you should still be able to spend your monero as long as you know which transactions are sent to your wallet. I guess the benefit of this is that offchain transaction linking is a lot harder, as you can\'t accidentally put the same receiving address at poloniex and at some DNM. Subaddresses will solve this with xmr, but it\'s not default. \n\n**Evaulation of the trade offs**\n\n\n*My personal opinion here, based on understandings that may be wrong*\n\n\n1) Coinjoin is an active form of mixing that can be sybil attacked. It can\'t be enforced at protocol level. Imho Ring signatures are way more effective as they actually are enforced by the network. \n\n\n2) The fact that analysis companies can still build a transaction graph is a huge risk, certainly coupled with the false sense of privacy that users will have. This is imho a bit of security theater: people think they are private, but in fact the analysis companies will have this info and can build a transaction graph.\n\n\n3) Yes, Grin protects against offchain linking but... it\'s a huge trade off: Grin has default protection against the noobish behaviour of putting in the same receiving addresses at different services. The trade off is the fact that no addresses exist and you need to actively exchange data to send money. One of the most under-appreciated aspects of xmr is imho the dual key stealth addresses. It makes it very easy to privately and passively receive funds. For example donation addresses work great with xmr.\n\n\n\n**Grin should function as a layer on XMR, here is why**\n\n\nIn my opinion, it\'s privacy first, scalability later. We need a fungible base chain and we shouldn\'t compromise on scalability for this. As Andreas Antonopoulos said (https://youtu.be/4w-bjUhpf_Q?t=3m42s) : \n\n\n> What is the important thing we need to achieve in the base layer is not scaling; the important thing we need to achieve in the base layer that CAN NOT be achieved in the layers above is fungiblity and privacy with strong guarantees and simple primitives. And if we have privacy primitives and fungibility primitives in the base layer than we can do scaling in the second layer and we can do it securely. Otherwise, we have a privacy problem. And that privacy problem will get magnified as we go up the layers. If you can do analysis on the base layer, that gives a great degree of insight into what\'s happening above.""\n\n\nWith this in the back of our mind, it\'s very important to have as much default & enforced privacy features as possible in the base layer (the base blockchain). This imho results in something like this:\n\n\n* Layer 0: Monero (default Ring Sigs, default CT, default Stealth addresses). No MW because all txo\'s in the base layer are preserved forever. The best security, no convoluted active sending of money. We actually need permanent storing of the txo\'s to make ring signatures work.\n\n* Layer 1: Grin-like layer with no ring sigs, relying on optional CoinJoin, and (if not possible otherwise) the interactive \'spendkey only\' addresses. Maybe it\'s possible to keep using the normal XMR addresses alongside these special ""interactive addresses"". We still have default CT. \n\n* Layer 2: We are now dropping the convoluted addressing system and replacing it with BTC-style transparent addresses, which is more user friendly. MW still makes it possible to ""drop"" input data from the blockchain (consider it extreme pruning). Possible to make CT optional, as for some use cases it may be useful to have transparent amounts (maybe colored coins / shares / tokens on the blockchain?).\n\n* Layer 3: maybe something more lightningchannel-like. So transparent addresses, no CT (as I don\'t think it\'s compatible with LN) and well, MW isn\'t necessary as the users themselves keep all transaction data until it needs to settle on the blockchain (i.e. layer 2). \n\n\nMy conclusion: Grin can help us scale, but I would be very hesitant calling the privacy features an improvement over xmr.'"

It will be just as common as swiping a card, flashing a QR code or handing over a bit of cash.\n\nBut we\'re not there yet. We don\'t have the adoption of other technologies such as TV (1960s), CDs (1980s), or internet (2000s). We can\'t justify the hype as we speak, even though we evidently *know* (believe) that we will eventually justify it by taking over the world of payments and ledgers and whatnot. Just not today, nor tomorrow, but some time later.\n\nIn a way, we\'re in the 1920s prior to 1929. Were these people crazy? No more than us, for they *knew* that stock markets were the future (and they were right, any one of them investing in sound stocks, even at their 1920s ATH, would have been prodigiously rich a few decades later). But no less crazy than us either, for we know it will get *worse* before it gets better.\n___\nWhat\'s the take-out of this post? Just that we should be responsible and on the lookout for signs of major events. Responsible, by vetting our commitments twice more than usually. On the lookout, because events will happen.\n\nI was a teenager back then but I remember the period before the 2000 dotcom crash. Lots of great ideas. Lots of major, corporate hype. Lots of dreams and idealism and perspectives of a world changing. Eventually all of it happened, just not the way most people thought, and not as quickly or easily. Nobody foresaw the smartphone, in particular, not the way it actually unfolded.\n\nWe had online chats, we had ICQ, MSN. But it\'s Facebook that changed it all, almost a decade later. We had Yahoo and even Google was already in development, but it\'s only years later that it became the power engine we know today. We had Amazon, but they were selling books mostly. The DVD was new tech back then. Apple hadn\'t released the iPod, only die-hard fans of the Macintosh were still buying their PowerPCs. IBM was a great company. And we hadn\'t yet experienced Episodes I-III, we were having theatrical remasters of IV-VI. VII was urban legend.\n\nI think... I think we\'re there, with cryptos. We have *yet* to see the Googles and Facebooks and Amazons and Blurays and Episode VII really bloom. Some of them are here already, in the midst of it all (1490 cryptos on CMC as I\'m typing this). If history is any indication, the true winners are not (all) among the stars today, they\'re more likely to be flying under the radar, doing the good work, diligently. Digitally gently. Some of them have yet to be invented.\n___\nAnd that was a long post but it\'s late and I had time to write. If you made it here, cheers. \n\nHave a wonderful year, friends.

It is enough to receive Moneroj.

As you mine more, the difficulty goes up, as the difficulty goes up, it takes longer to mine, making power become a big factor into the cost. Eventually, you pay more to mine than you make out of mining.\n\n\nIt's those main principles that the mass market need to comprehend, in order for it to be more accepted into society, knowing why something holds value.

So even if they were considered taxable, the taxable amount is zero.  Also, I don't see how any fork, including Bitcoin Cash can be taxable until you make a transaction on the new chain.

Meaning, for quite some time now, with quantitative easing and injection of fiat into our system via the central banks to keep the system propped up ever since 2008, there is literally quadrillions worth of outstanding derivatives. We\'re talking, debt on top of debt on top of debt on top of debt and so forth.  This has gone on for quite some time, longer than what people were predicting before a complete meltdown would occur.  I can see, the \'powers that be\' even moving into cryptos in various ways to expand their broken debt based monetary system into.  Although they may not like cryptos, there\'s no where left into the system in the coming years ahead to expand out into. \n\nOne day, there could be quadrillions worth of debt pouring into cryptos.  Then you might really be seeing $500 ETN.  We should have already hit the point years ago of hyperinflation with the amount of fiat that has been printed and injected into the system for free (wall street, securities, bail outs, etc.).  So they\'ve artificially have been able to prevent hyperinflation.  People have said, if you can actually have a $500 ETN, then obviously there would massive hyperinflation.  Not quite, we would have already had massive hyperinflation by now.  \n\nI\'m surprised that even BTC futures were created.  So that indicates that wall street is dipping their toes into the water.  There could be a possibility of a massive tsunami of fiat pouring into cryptos one day.

7,b'Escrow with multisig 2/2 + smart contract.',2,"b""Are you looking into doing a dominant assurance contract with this? \nI'm the OP of the post you're linking too and I have a solution that I think works fairly okay for it. It uses a coinjoin type thing: a single transaction that uses two different private keys - either the defined coins from both private keys are sent to the multisig address or none of them as it would be an invalid transaction at that point. I believe you just need to form the key image(?) of the transaction using two people's private keys, which can be done in a trustless manner. \nThat works well for a dominant assurance contract; you send X, and I send Y - then either you can all the funds back (your initial donation X, + reward Y), or I get all the funds - and the public good is funded... \nOf course, you still have to look into game theory issues with 2/2 multisig transactions and potentially anonymous parties holding the others funds hostage, or sacrfice that risk by doing 2/3 multisig transactions by involving a third party and then opening yourself up to risks of collusion, or sybil attack with the arbiter/escrow agent. \n\n\nTimelock is tricky with Monero as it is different than with most cryptocurrencies, and the way Monero does it actually results in issues with doing cross chain atomic swaps in as trustless of a manner as something like BTC vs LTC.\n I can't remember the exact differences, but it seems like Monero's transactions happened but only became valid/spendable when the time passed, and it has less functionality due to ring signatures, you can't have invalid timelock transactions get mixed in with ring signatures as that opens a gateway for some attack -- not totally sure, and would love for someone to elaborate further on the differences between Monero and Bitcoins timelock transactions. \n\n"""

6,b'Why all coins slide when Bitcoin dips?',5,"b""It has to do with how people diversify their portfolio of coins. Like most stock/things that change value over time, you really don't want all your money in one item. That item can crash and burn for no predictable reason, resulting in you losing all your money. Rather, the best option is to invest a little bit in a lot of things. This ensures that so long as the general trend of the market is positive, you always win. Thus, larger investors are invested in most coins. When they see bitcoin dip (bitcoin being a very good estimator of the status of the market), they sell a bit of everything, causing everything to follow bitcoins trends to some degree. Once bytecoin gains good traction (as it should if the devs follow through with the 2018 roadmap), the coin will start to have more independent movement from bitcoin. It will still follow it though, I doubt any alt-coin will ever fully break free from bitcoin trends. Anywho, my 2 cents."""

Currently, within the web interface used by many of the mining pools (and exposed via an API), there is a ""Personal Threshold"" value that is publicly editable. This setting determines how much coin must be mined before the payout will be sent to the attacker\'s wallet.

You would have to assume that the key is actively abused for some extra inflation. For ZenCash to look at this and not only copy the concept but actually the entire setup procedure is beyond ridiculous.\n \nBoth ZCash and ZenCash have a big tax that rewards the founders while providing little incentive for development. Perhaps that's why so little is happening there? Monero works with a Forum Funding system that works surprisingly well and benefits the whole crypto community through projects like Kovri. [See it here](https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress)\n \nNot sure what the purpose of projects like ZenCash and ZCash is, but private currencies they are not.\n \nWhen you have some time on your hands, look into fungibility.

I still possess the BCN and told them I was holding it for them until next Christmas and at that time, would give them the option of continuing to hold or cash out.  The beauty of this lesson is that they got fiat and a store card, which will only decrease in value.  Unless BCN dies and disappears (not happening) their 5000 BCN will increase in value.

Does everyone just put their trust into the contributors and core developers for Monero? \n\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWe put our trust into the community because we work as a team. The contributors worked extremely hard to make their vision become into a reality and everyone had the chance to buy XMR, which made it fair/equal distribution. Contributors get funded based on their proposals and the communities acceptance, which anyone can participate in, check out the Forum Funding System (FFS). Privacy is one of the visions Monero has; which compliments it's fungibility and security to make sure no third parties put your funds at risk of being frozen for tainted historical transactions regarding something you did not do.

The node and wallet code is open-source, you can review it and compile it yourself, then join the network from any place on Earth. There is no rich list for Monero, and every user is equal.\n\nIf someone notices a problem in the code, they'd report a problem on the GitHub, or make a reddit post. People would know there is a problem. Someone would write a code patch to fix the problem. Person submitting the bug and the person writing a patch to it can be completely anonymous, but they work in unison, towards a better goal.\n\nI could compare this to a person in the street donating pocket change to a beggar. They don't know each other, they are anonymous, but still act according to the moral idea of generosity.\n\nTo destroy Monero you'd need to very carefully infiltrate rouge coders to their community, then allow them access to the GitHub repository, from where they can place exploits in the code. This is very hard thing to do. Even if someone manages to place enough exploits to allow Monero to be tracked, a code review by a third party, or by random people interested in cryptography, would reveal the bug and mitigate a solution."""

Yes its long, but i believe my questions are valid. Thank you for your time'",1,"b""If I understand you correctly, you're asking how easy or difficult it would be for Monero developers to use *inside knowledge* in order to profit from exchange-rate moves. (Some might say that's a question for r/xmrtrader, but susceptibility (or resistance) to insider dealing impinges on *adoption*, and *adoption* is within the remit of r/monero.)\n\nSo, you're implicitly asking about the visibility of the following two scenarios:\n\n1. Someone invents a technical improvement in Monero's code, which upon implementation will prompt new demand for Monero.\n\n2. Someone discovers a bug in Monero's code, which if not fixed will diminish the functionality of Monero and prompt holders to sell *en masse*.\n\nScenario 1 is frequent, quantifiable and transparent. *You* have complete freedom to audit new code in the Monero GitHub repository, and so does everyone else with an internet connection. More to the point, you have the opportunity to audit new code *before* it gets incorporated into the current release, so there's no insider trading opportunity here. Even if you don't intend to audit any code yourself, you may be interested to read [how GitHub works](https://guides.github.com/).\n\nScenario 2 is more interesting, and the examples to date are reassuring. For instance, in 2017 a counterfeiting bug (affecting *all* CryptoNote currencies) was discovered by Monero researchers. Read their announcement [in this link](https://getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html) and [reddit discussion in this link](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6buu5j/disclosure_of_a_major_bug_in_cryptonotebased/).\n\nThe counterfeiting bug in Monero was fixed (an emergency new release) **before** anyone exploited it. You're asking about risks arising from the inherent privacy, and the answer for the counterfeiting bug is that the total circulating coin supply is knowable, so we *know* that no counterfeits entered the supply. \nMonero developers with advance knowledge of the bug *could* have indulged in insider trading of counterfeit coins for a few hours (at most!), but they didn't.\n\nIn contrast, the Bytecoin developers *did* [allegedly](https://github.com/amjuarez/bytecoin/issues/104) exploit the counterfeiting bug. If we ignore personal morality for a moment, the difference is that the Bytecoin counterfeiters had nothing to lose (Bytecoin was already widely mistrusted), whereas Monero is a large and healthy [golden goose](https://www.umass.edu/aesop/content.php?n=14&i=1) that's worth keeping alive.\n\nYou may also find [this paper](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0002.pdf) relevant to your question: it concerns an earlier bug that resurfaced recently in a shady Monero-clone cryptocurrency.\n\nEDIT: mistyped link"""

1,b'4 Common lies Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency sceptics tell themselves',2,"b'Good article.  About the only thing that fiat banking systems have over cryptos is that you can\'t lose your money with a bank. With a crypto, if you have an offline wallet and lost your keys, or lost a wallet that wasn\'t backed up, then you\'ve lost your cryptos forever.  If someone managed to steal your cryptos, you\'ve lost them forever.  A bank can insure those things. If a bank gets robbed, your money is insured for up to $250K for example.  Also, the dollar is backed by a military to ensure it is used as currency.  Cryptos do not.  A new crypto can move into the neighborhood stealing the value from other cryptos.  You cannot launch a war with a military to prevent the other crypto from existing.  So in the crypto world, when someone goes to ""war"" to discredit another cryto, they go onto reddit threads and YouTube comment sections to make up lies and spread FUD about the coin they don\'t want around.  ETN is a great example of that.  \n\nIf somehow a blockchain could be created that can offer all the other securities/insurance policies/guarantees, then that crypto will give banks a run for their money...literally.
